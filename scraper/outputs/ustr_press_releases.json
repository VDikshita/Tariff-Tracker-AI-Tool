We envision an ambitious, forward-looking framework that not only solidifies our existing alliance but establishes the global benchmark for digital trade, technological governance, and economic security.”nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation President Zippy Duvall:“Farm Bureau appreciates the work between the administration and the United Kingdom to secure a new trade agreement. We have long advocated for new trade deals, and this is an important first step in expanding markets in the four countries.”nU.S. Grains Council President and CEO Ryan LeGrand:“This deal is a huge win specifically for U.S. ethanol producers, allowing them to expand even more into our second largest market for ethanol.”nGrowth Energy CEO Emily Skor:“This trade agreement puts us on track to set another record, all to the benefit of American farmers, biofuel producers, and UK consumers . . . We commend the President and his team for making this deal and creating new opportunities for American ethanol and rural America.”nNational Association of State Departments of Agriculture CEO Ted McKinney:“This agreement marks a significant step forward for U.S. farmers and ranchers, and U.K. agriculture and consumers as well.

While we are still awaiting the specific details of the agreement, we are excited about the prospects of expanded market access that will help boost our farm economy, while also delivering lower-cost, cleaner fuel to UK drivers.”nJob Creators Network CEO Alfredo Ortiz:“President Trump’s tough tariff stance is starting to pay dividends in the form of fairer and freer trade deals that put America first. The many more deals to come will greatly improve the small business economy, financial markets, and American prosperity.”nNational Corn Growers Association President Kenneth Hartman Jr.:“This is great news.

President Trump just delivered a huge win for hardworking Americans. Let’s keep them coming!”nSenator Jerry Moran:\"The UK offers a strategic market for American aviation & agricultural products.

The EU has rejected attempts under successive U.S. administrations to cooperate effectively on dealing with global excess capacity on steel, aluminum, and other sectors, employing measures that are too little and too late.nIf the EU acted as quickly to address global excess capacity as it does to punish the United States, we likely would be in a different situation today. The EU’s punitive action completely disregards the national security imperatives of the United States – and indeed international security – and is yet another indicator that the EU’s trade and economic policies are out of step with reality.\"n###n",

The strategy is the first time the United States has laid out a comprehensive approach to using trade tools to combat forced labor. It includes a range of actions the United States is taking and will consider utilizing to address forced labor.“Combatting forced labor has been a centerpiece of the Biden-Harris Administration’s worker-centered trade policy,”said Ambassador Katherine Tai. “While there is more work to be done, this strategy is how USTR is driving a race to the top and addressing this form of unfair economic competition that hurts and dehumanizes people all around the world.”The Trade Strategy to Combat Forced Labor outlines a number of goals and priority actions that USTR has achieved during the Biden-Harris Administration, as well as areas for potential future action. From work on theUyghur Forced Labor Prevention Actand theUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreementto launching the first ever Section 301 investigation of acts, policies, and practices that may constitute violations of labor rights inNicaragua, this strategy demonstrates how the United States has made major strides in using trade to combat forced labor and how to build on those efforts going forward. In doing so, USTR hopes to make trade policy a force for good and to use trade policy to end forced labor.USTR has developed this strategy in close consultation with the interagency partners and dedicated labor and business stakeholders who work tirelessly to eliminate forced labor from U.S. supply chains. In launching this strategy, USTR commends them for their ongoing work on this critical issue.BackgroundUnited States Trade Representative Katherine Tai announced the development of this strategy in conjunction with theNational Action Plan to Combat Human Trafficking; Memorandum on Advancing Worker Empowerment, Rights, and High Labor Standards Globally; and the National Action Plan on Responsible Business Conduct. The development of this strategy included an interagency review of USTR’s existing trade policies and tools used to combat forced labor. USTR sought public comment on the development of this strategy and has undertaken an inclusive process that maximizes input from stakeholders, including labor organizations, civil society, survivors, and the private sector.A copy of the Forced Labor Trade Strategy is availablehere.nn###n",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) today announced tariff increases under Section 301 for imports from the People’s Republic of China of certain tungsten products, wafers, and polysilicon. The rates for solar wafers and polysilicon will increase to 50 percent, and the rates for certain tungsten products will increase to 25 percent. These tariff increases will take effect on January 1, 2025.“The tariff increases announced today will further blunt the harmful policies and practices by the People’s Republic of China. These actions will complement the domestic investments made under the Biden-Harris Administration to promote a clean energy economy, while increasing the resilience of critical supply chains,”said Ambassador Katherine Tai.The federal notice for today’s announcement can be foundhere.BackgroundThe tariff increases announced today had been proposed as part of the statutory review of the tariff actions in the Section 301 investigation of the People’s Republic of China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation.  These modifications conclude the statutory review. In the USTR Report on the statutory review, the U.S. Trade Representative found that, while the PRC had changed some specific unfair measures, the PRC’s harmful forced technology transfer practices – in particular its cyber theft and industrial espionage – have continued, and in some instances, worsened. The findings of the four-year review can be found on USTR’swebsite.In light of those findings, Ambassador Tai modified the Section 301 tariff actions by targeting strategic sectors for tariff increases, improving the effectiveness of the tariff actions in achieving the objectives of the investigation, while promoting American jobs and investments. For example, Ambassador Tai increased tariffs (with various effective dates) on electric vehicles, syringes and needles, and medical gloves (100 percent); semiconductors, solar cells, and facemasks (50 percent); and steel and aluminum products, certain critical minerals, and others (25 percent).

    "content": "WASHINGTON – In the Financial Times today, Rana Foroohar touts the Biden-Harris Administration’s work to revitalizing the American economy by promoting worker-centered trade policy.Foroohar writes that “[t]he problem in the global economy today isn’t tariff barriers — it’s concentrated power, be it in states […] or companies.” The Biden-Harris Administration is tackling this issue by delivering fair competition and fair trade – which in turn helps our workers and small businesses thrive.Read more below:Financial Times:Opinion | Power, as well as price, matters in a well-run economy[Rana Foroohar, 10/21/24]nThat’s the lesson to take from both the founding of the Bretton Woods system 80 years ago and the Biden administration today.nJoe Biden may be a one-term president, but his administration has changed the global political economy in ways that will continue to resonate long after he is gone. In particular, his trade policy put an end to the era of laissez-faire globalisation, which tended to favour the unfettered interests of the largest corporations and state actors, and ushered in a post-neoliberal era in which labour, natural resources and the market-distorting effects of concentrated power are once again major concerns for policymakers.Critics like to portray this shift as some kind of wacky, woke deviation from economic norms. It is certainly a change from the trickle-down, market-knows-best approach of the last half century. But the Biden stance actually takes the US back to the first principles of the post-second world war period during which the Bretton Woods institutions were established. Back then, US leaders tried, and only partially succeeded, in crafting a postcolonial, worker-centred approach to trade, one that looks a lot like what the Biden White House has tried quite rightly to resuscitate.Consider the original 1945 state department proposals on world trade and employment. They argued against government restrictions on trade, but also recognised the power of private actors to distort the system, as well as the need for states to guarantee regularity in the production of critical goods and secure employment at home.[…]The worries that European states had about each other in the 1930s are clearly analogous to those that many countries today have about China exporting its own employment and overproduction issues to the rest of the world.That’s why the US proposals acknowledged that “no government is ready to embrace ‘free trade’ in any absolute sense . . . Trade may also be restricted by business interests in order to obtain the unfair advantage of monopoly . . . Firms have banded together to restrain competition . . . these practices destroy fair competition and fair trade, damage new businesses and small businesses, and levy an unjust toll upon consumers. Upon occasion, they may be even more destructive of world trade than are restrictions imposed by governments.”This sounds a lot like the Biden administration’s theories around antitrust and competition policy, which dovetail with its trade policy. The problem in the global economy today isn’t tariff barriers — it’s concentrated power, be it in states (like China) or companies (be they meatpackers or giant technology platforms). Building multiple nodes of production and consumption globally, and ensuring high labour and environmental standards, requires public restraint of undue power, no matter where it comes from.Sadly, the initial US government approach to the Bretton Woods institutions was watered down by American business interests in the run-up to the creation of the Gatt (later the WTO), and they were further eroded in the 1970s with the turn towards the Chicago school notion that price not power matters in a well-functioning economy.[…]The great triumph of the Biden administration is that it has reawakened America and to a great extent the world to an understanding that power exists in the political economy, and all of the challenges of the day — from Chinese steel and aluminium dumping to Big Tech monopoly power to recurring financial crises, supply chain disruption and the evolution of AI — will require an approach that puts power, not just price, at the centre of market-making.I take great heart from the fact that the most recent Nobel laureates in economics, Simon Johnson, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, have a body of work that argues for exactly that. In a recent CEPR webcast, Johnson points out that the “postcolonial” vision put forward by the Biden administration, one focused on people and planet rather than merely price, is what the Bretton Woods system meant to deliver before it was hijacked by powerful state and corporate interests.It’s a point well worth remembering as we look to reinvent these institutions and reform global trade today.n###",

    "content": "“Fundamentally, what we’re doing is innovating the way you do trade policy, innovating the way globalization is going to play out into the future.”nWASHINGTON – In interviews with the Associated Press and AFP, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai highlighted the Biden-Harris Administration’s worker-centered trade policy and what it means for workers, both home and abroad.Ambassador Tai illustrated how a worker-centered trade policy is bolstering manufacturing, and supporting American jobs and key industries through important trade tools like tariffs and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement’s Rapid Response Mechanism.The Biden-Harris Administration's trade policy prioritizes labor standards over mass production, protects workers instead of large corporations, promotes resilient supply chains in the 21stcentury global economy, and builds an economy from the bottom up and the middle out.Read excerpts below:Associated Press:Top US trade official sees progress in helping workers. Voters will decide if her approach continues[Josh Boak, 10/06/24]Tai has degrees from Yale University and Harvard Law School, but strives for a blue-collar perspective on trade. She said that she has injected once-excluded labor union voices into the trade process.[…]Tai sees herself as having a proof of concept that her approach to trade can thrive. It just happens to come from theU.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the revised North American trade deal signed during the Trump administration and cited by Trump as evidence that he knows how to negotiate with the rest of the world.In her interview, Tai said the agreement includes a “rapid response mechanism” that enables the government to penalize factories that violate workers’ rights. Tai said that as of late September, the U.S. government has invoked the mechanism 28 times and concluded 25 of those efforts.Tai said that has directly benefited 30,000 Mexican workers who could elect their own union representation, allowing them to receive higher wages, back pay and other benefits.“We are empowering workers through trade,” she said. “And by empowering Mexico’s workers, we are ensuring that America’s workers do not have to compete with workers in our neighboring country who are being exploited and who are being deprived of rights.”[…]She notes that there were actually two negotiations on trade with Canada and Mexico. The first negotiation was among the Trump administration and the other two nations. But the second was between Trump’s team and congressional Democrats who needed to ratify the deal and that led to worker protections, a component Tai worked on when she was a congressional staffer.But then, she added, just getting a written deal on trade protections and rights is never enough. The text needs to be backed up by action.“They’re just words on the page unless it’s implemented,” she said.AFP:US trade chief defends tariff hikes when paired with investment[Beiyi Seow, 10/04/24]US Trade Representative Katherine Tai defended stiff tariff hikes against countries like China, arguing that paired with investment, they were a \"legitimate and constructive\" tool for re-invigorating domestic industries.Tai's comments to AFP come a week after sharp tariff increases on Chinese electric vehicles, EV batteries and solar cells took effect -- with levies down the line on other products also recently finalized.The latest moves targeting $18 billion in Chinese goods come weeks before November's US presidential election, with both Democrats and Republicans pushing a hard line on China as competition between Washington and Beijing intensifies.In an interview Thursday looking back on her term, Tai defended the use of tariffs as a means \"to counterbalance unfair trade\" with China.The latest hikes, she added, aim to help US clean energy investments \"take root.\"\"We wanted to make sure that those increased areas are paired with the investments that we're making,\" Tai said, referring to efforts to build domestic industries like those for EVs, batteries and semiconductors.\"Once you've lost an industry, bringing it back from the brink is much, much harder,\" she said.n###",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Small Business, Market Access, and Industrial Competitiveness Sushan Demirjian today delivered the following remarks to members of the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity (GFSEC).In her remarks, Ms. Demirjian noted that the current international trade rules are inadequate to address the types of behavior and policies that have led to global excess capacity in the steel industry. Ms. Demirjian reaffirmed the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to working with like-minded partners who want to restore market-oriented conditions and address the emissions intensity of the steel industry.A link to the GFSEC Ministerial Statement can be foundhere.Assistant U.S. Trade Representative Demirjian’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below:Thank you, Minister Alexander. On behalf of U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai, I would like to start by thanking the United Kingdom for chairing this Forum and its leadership over the past year.  I also want to thank the OECD Secretariat for the technical expertise and logistical support it provides the Forum.In addition, I would like to recognize the OECD Facilitator’s presentation on the trends in global steelmaking capacity. Global excess capacity is growing to crisis levels; according to the OECD, excess capacity stood at 551 million metric tons in 2023 and is expected to increase to 630 million metric tons in 2026. Excess capacity is leading to significant negative impacts on the steel sector, including through trade distortions, pressure on steel prices, and displacing efficient market-based production.For many years, we’ve discussed the causes behind excess capacity in the global steel industry, in particular, the state-directed industrial targeting in the People’s Republic of China and the lack of market-oriented conditions in the PRC and other economies.This continues to harm our workers and businesses, creates strategic dependencies and systemic vulnerabilities, and undermines our decarbonization efforts.One clear conclusion is that current international trade rules are inadequate to discipline the types of behavior and policies that have caused this crisis.That is why addressing global steel excess capacity should be a priority for all governments—for the future of our steel and other critical industrial sectors and also the functioning of and confidence in the multilateral trading system.We are pleased to see that GFSEC members agree on the need to take concrete actions to address the root causes and consequences of excess capacity in their economies. The United States believes this should include the development of new trade monitoring and enforcement tools, and more creative and aggressive use of existing tools.We also welcome the progress made in the GFSEC over the past year, including new analysis by the OECD Facilitator on the impacts of excess capacity on trade and employment.We strongly support enhancing the Facilitator’s analytical capabilities through the creation of a new global excess capacity monitor.We welcome recent actions by our trading partners, particularly Canada and Mexico, to address the impact of non-market excess capacity and other non-market policies and practices.We strongly encourage other countries to undertake similar measures.Excess capacity also harms our planet. It exacerbates the climate crisis by prolonging emissions-intensive production and inhibiting the industry’s ability to undertake the investments in existing and emerging technologies that are necessary to reduce emissions.To this end, the United States is committed to working with like-minded partners who want to restore market-oriented conditions and address the emissions intensity of the steel industry.Lastly, I want to share that in follow-up to USTR’s engagement with stakeholders earlier this year regarding ways to promote supply chain resilience, USTR is considering how non-market policies and practices, including non-market excess capacity, threaten the integrity of our supply chains.These issues are critically interlinked. Non-market policies and practices harm our workers and businesses by creating concentration of production, dependence, and chokepoints.USTR is actively considering how trade rules can help address these issues and strengthen our supply chains.Within the coming months, USTR expects to release additional policy ideas on defining and responding to non-market policies and practices. We will continue to consult a wide range of stakeholders as we focus on this important work.Mr. Chair, the Ministerial Statement before us is one that the United States strongly supports. We look forward to continued cooperation with GFSEC members next year. Thank you.nn###",

USTR requested the Government of Peru to verify that five timber shipments exported to the United States from Peru complied with applicable Peruvian laws and regulations. This is the third such verification request under the PTPA, which entered into force in 2009. The timber verification provision is a monitoring tool provided in the PTPA to ensure robust monitoring and enforcement of Peruvian forestry laws throughout the supply chain.The United States and Peru closely collaborate on timber-related issues under the PTPA. However, despite improvements in some areas, there are still serious concerns about illegal logging in Peru. Yesterday’s action reflects USTR’s commitment to work with Peru under the PTPA to address continued challenges and help ensure that Peruvian timber is legally harvested and violators are held accountable.BackgroundThe PTPA contains an enforceable Environment Chapter and associated landmark Forest Sector Annex, which includes a requirement for Peru to conduct audits and verifications of particular timber producers and exporters upon request from the United States and provides for U.S. participation in the verification process. The PTPA further permits the United States to take compliance measures based on the results of such verifications.To read more about the PTPA Forest Annex, please clickhere.n###",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) today announced final modifications concerning the statutory review of the tariff actions in the Section 301 investigation of the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation.The proposed modifications announced in May 2024 were largely adopted, with several updates to strengthen the actions to protect American businesses and workers from China’s unfair trade practices following the review of more than 1,100 comments from the public.“Today’s finalized tariff increases will target the harmful policies and practices of the People’s Republic of China that continue to impact American workers and businesses,”said Ambassador Katherine Tai. “These actions underscore the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to standing up for American workers and businesses in the face of unfair trade practices.”The updates improve the effectiveness of the tariff actions in achieving the objectives of the investigation, while considering other actions that could be taken and the overall effects of the tariff actions on the U.S. economy.These updates do not reflect further consideration or alteration of the review’s finding that, while the PRC had changed some specific unfair measures, the PRC’s harmful forced technology transfer practices – in particular its cyber theft and industrial espionage – have continued, and in some instances, worsened.  The findings of the four-year review can be found on USTR’swebsite.The updates in today’s announcement include new timing and rates for tariffs on face masks, medical gloves, needles, and syringes; an exclusion for enteral syringes; a proposal regarding coverage of additional tungsten, wafers, and polysilicon tariff lines; an exclusion for ship-to-shore cranes ordered prior to May 14, 2024; an expansion of the scope of the machinery exclusions process to include five additional tariff lines; and modification of the coverage of proposed exclusions for solar manufacturing equipment.Information on the revisions to modifications are detailed in USTR’s Federal Register Notice, which is availablehere.USTR expects to launch the machinery exclusions process soon, as well as the comment period for proposed modifications of tariff rates on certain tungsten, wafers, and polysilicon tariff lines.BackgroundIn May 2022, USTR commenced the statutory four-year review process by notifying representatives of domestic industries that benefit from the tariff actions of the possible termination of those actions and of the opportunity for the representatives to request continuation.  In September 2022, USTR announced that because requests for continuation were received, the tariff actions had not terminated and USTR would conduct a review of the tariff actions.  USTR opened a docket on November 15, 2022, for interested persons to submit comments with respect to a number of considerations concerning the review.  USTR received nearly 1,500 comments.As part of the statutory review process, throughout 2023 and early 2024, USTR and the Section 301 Committee, a subordinate, staff-level body of the USTR-led, interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC), held numerous meetings with agency experts concerning the review and the comments received.Specifically, the Report concludes:n###",

We have gathered to further deepen our strong economic ties through cooperative initiatives that reflect our shared values and objectives as articulated in our Leaders’ East Room Declaration.We reaffirm the importance of existing trade agreements among us. We intend for the Americas Partnership to complement these mechanisms and support regional integration, so that they can deliver broadly shared, lasting benefits to more people in the Americas. We further reaffirm the importance of the rules-based multilateral trading system, with the WTO at its core, in providing predictability for businesses and supporting sustainable economic growth.We further recognize that internationally recognized labor rights, environmental sustainability, and economic inclusion are essential to achieve a more open, fair, and prosperous hemisphere. Accordingly, at this meeting we have established new committees dedicated to Trade and Labor and to Trade and Environment, to ensure that the trade work of the Partnership will reflect these common values.We celebrate the first annual meeting of the Experts Dialogue on Trade Facilitation, which took place in Bogotá on July 24-25 with the support of the Global Alliance on Trade Facilitation and the Inter-American Development Bank. Experts from all twelve Partnership countries participated in the Dialogue, which focused on the implementation of key obligations in theWTO Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA):pre-arrival processing, border agency cooperation, and single window. Full implementation of these customs practices to a high standard will reduce barriers to trade among our economies, including for SMEs; promote broad economic participation; and strengthen regional value and supply chains. Building on the discussion during the event, we have adopted aDeclaration on Good Practices for Pre-Arrival Processing, which lays out specific goals to more effectively implement the WTO TFA in these areas, and includes the use of modern practices, including digitalization, for more effective risk management and movement of legitimate trade.We welcome the active dialogue between government officials and stakeholders, to work together to identify and address challenges for intra-regional trade, and we pledge to further integrate stakeholder dialogue into our work.We directed the Senior Officials of the Council on Trade and Competitiveness (CTC) to continue to advance our agenda of sustainable trade and regional integration by taking the following actions before the next meeting of Partnership Trade Ministers, working through Americas Partnership Trade Committees as appropriate:nWe extend our appreciation to the government of Ecuador for hosting this meeting, and to the CTC and all the officials and non-governmental participants who continue to advance our Leaders’ vision for a more prosperous hemisphere through equitable trade and investment practices. We look forward to convening in the coming months, before the next Leaders’ Summit in Costa Rica.n###",

In her remarks, Ambassador Tai affirmed the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to work with Americas Partnership economies to use trade to deliver better results for more people across the region.Ambassador Tai’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below:nGood morning, everyone. Welcome to the first face-to-face meeting of the Americas Partnership trade ministers.I know we have had virtual gatherings, but it is truly special when we are able to be in the same room together.I want to start by thanking Minister García for hosting us. Thank you for your hospitality and making us feel welcome in this beautiful city of Quito.This is my first time in Ecuador, and I was able to take a look around the Historical Center.As I walked through sprawling plazas and incredible architecture dating back centuries, I was reminded of something very basic but fundamentally important—which is that wherever you go, whether that is here in Quito, in Nairobi, Kenya, or Detroit, Michigan, in the United States, people have wanted the same thing, for generations.That is to provide for our families.  To give our children a better future than we had.  And a desire for these dreams to be durable and lasting.We all aspire to greater opportunity, to enjoy our fair share of the economic pie, to be a part of economic growth and access its benefits.To get there, people must be at the center our economic policies, because without people, you have no economy.This is foundational to what we are trying to accomplish under the Americas Partnership.When our leaders gathered in Washington, D.C. last November, they directed us to begin building our shared economic prosperity through three lines of work: foreign affairs, trade, and finance.They also emphasized that the work of these tracks should be ambitious and complementary.And now, less than a year later, our work has truly begun, and we are making real progress.Our countries already have deep trade and economic relationships, based on long-standing agreements and preference programs.  And yet, we are all here because we know our trade relationships can be so much more.We need to think creatively and outside the box, so that our work enables our people to not only overcome today’s challenges but also seize tomorrow’s opportunities.That is exactly what we are doing through the Americas Partnership, and specifically through the Trade Track.I know our Senior Officials and technical experts have been busy implementing our Leaders’ guidance in the East Room Declaration.One example is the work we are doing through the Inclusive Trade and SMEs Committee.If we want our trade policies to work for our people, we need to make sure that smaller companies and their workers are at the table.We need to make sure that more people—especially those that have been historically left out of trade discussions—not only have a seat at the table but that their priorities are reflected in our work.This is the focus of other ongoing work under the Trade Track—like advancing strong labor standards, tackling the climate crisis, and providing greater opportunities for SMEs to trade within our hemisphere through improved trade facilitation measures and promoting the use of digital signatures.On that last topic of trade facilitation, I know that the Committee on Trade Rules and Transparency has been actively considering best practices for implementing the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement, including at the first annual Americas Partnership Experts Dialogue on Trade Facilitation, which took place in Bogotá just last week.This is just one example of how we can work together to further deepen our economic engagement and integration within our hemisphere.At its core, this is about building resilience, including for our supply chains.For the Biden-Harris Administration, this is much more than just moving goods around.  Our goal is to craft our supply chains in a way that advances our core values.We have a real opportunity to work together on issues of common interest that affect our hemisphere and our people.  This includes focusing more on empowering workers and driving a race to the top for our shared planet.We know this will not be easy.  But I am confident that, together, we can create something truly unique and lasting that will benefit our people in the long run.So, as we take stock of the progress we have made so far, let’s also challenge ourselves to be ambitious as we advance the work of the Partnership and prepare for the Leaders’ Summit in Costa Rica next year.Let me conclude with where I started.I learned that Quito’s Historical Center was granted UNESCO World Heritage Status in 1978.  It was included in the very first group of sites designated by UNESCO, for being “the best-preserved, least-altered historic center in Latin America.”This was despite a massive earthquake in 1917 that threatened to destroy this beautiful heritage.This history shows us that Quito and its people symbolize resilience, grace, and devotion in the face of turbulence.So, as our economies continue to adapt to a changing world—as we all grapple with uncertainty and unknowns—it’s very appropriate that we are gathered here, to reaffirm our commitment to work toward our collective future.Thank you again for hosting us, and I look forward to our discussions.nn###",

    "content": "As Prepared for DeliverynJoy, thank you so much for that introduction.  You have done an incredible job as our master of ceremonies during the Forum, and your colleagues have also done a magnificent job planning and organizing.  Thank you.Hello everyone, and good afternoon.As President Biden said, “In so many ways, Africa is the future—and so when Africa succeeds, the whole world succeeds.”By 2050, one in four people in the entire world will be in Africa.  That means what happens in Africa impacts the entire world.This is why the Biden-Harris Administration is all in on Africa.We’re all in as a genuine partner.  Partnering for an open and fair society.  Partnering for economic empowerment and inclusive prosperity—for all our people.AGOA has played an instrumental role in realizing this vision, and the AGOA Forum this week allowed us to have constructive discussions on how we can get there.We heard from labor, civil society, and private sector leaders.We explored barriers that women, youth, MSMEs, and the African Diaspora face in accessing trade and investment opportunities and how we can use the AGOA more effectively to drive inclusive and sustainable economic growth.We explored how to better use the multilateral trading system to benefit more people, particularly underserved communities.We also discussed opportunities to modernize the AGOA program to realize its full potential as a tool for development and regional economic integration.  And we discussed how the United States and AGOA partners can collectively create and promote stronger high-standard investment opportunities.The commitment of everyone here is what will get us there.No one government or institution can do this alone.  Crafting the future, we all want to see must be a collective effort—a partnership where we continue to push and pull one another to make a positive difference in people’s lives.Speaking of partnership, there are many who made this Forum possible.My sincere appreciation to the AGOA statutory U.S. agencies – including State, Treasury, Commerce and USAID – and the entire U.S. government inter-agency who were integral throughout the planning process.Special thanks to the Department of State for the warm and welcoming hospitality and immense effort to make the Forum a success.A big thank you to the African Union Commission and the Trade Ministers and their delegations for the productive dialogue and engagement.A special thanks to our private sector, civil society and labor stakeholders. Your dedication to AGOA will continue to make the program more responsive to the new challenges and opportunities for all segments of society.My deep appreciation to the U.S. Members of Congress that joined us in this Forum.  The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to working with our Congress to make AGOA a continued success for years to come.And of course, the USTR team—thank you for all you are and all you do.  I greatly appreciate each and every one of you.We’ve said it multiple times but let me say it again—AGOA remains the cornerstone of the U.S. economic partnership with Africa.Let us not forget that our work does not happen in the abstract—it impacts real lives across the continent.Africa has a special place in my heart.As the Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Africa, I’ve had the privilege of traveling to many parts of the continent, meeting different people and hearing their stories.So, I know firsthand how vibrant and dynamic they are.The workers and their families.  The women business owners.  The tech entrepreneurs.  Young musicians.  Farmers using climate-smart agriculture.  And many more.AGOA has been a bedrock to improve the livelihoods of so many people.  And it has the potential to do so much more.A lot of what we discussed over the last three days was precisely on this topic.Making the program more effective and relevant to today’s challenges, like growing inequality and the climate crisis.  Improving usage of the program by smaller African economies so they too can share in the benefits.We had honest conversations about these goals.  And we explored how to transform the multilateral trading system to benefit more people, particularly underserved communities.We have a lot of work ahead of us, but as we bring this Forum to a conclusion, Ambassador Tai and I leave optimistic and hopeful.I am heartened by our conversation with the U.S. Members of Congress and their commitment to reauthorization and willingness to explore how we can modernize the legislation to the benefit of people across Africa and in America.I am encouraged by everyone’s views on how trade can and must help craft a fairer and more equitable future for Africa – delivering real opportunities across all segments of societies, including women, youth, the African Diaspora, and other underserved groups.Over the past 24 years, AGOA has made a tangible difference for millions of people in Africa.  New jobs.  New business opportunities.  New hope.AGOA has not only strengthened economic relations with the United States, but also has helped create African-led solutions to the region's challenges.And importantly, AGOA has created a community of policymakers, civil society, and business leaders, dedicated to using this forum to better the lives of everyday people.I am confident that we can continue to make meaningful progress.Let us move forward with enthusiasm and a commitment to the work ahead of us as we write the next chapter of our AGOA story together.Thank you.n###",

    "url": "https://ustr.gov//about-us/policy-offices/press-office/speeches-and-remarks/2024/july/trade-policy-review-peoples-republic-china",
    "content": "As DeliverednThe United States welcomes H.E. Mr. LI Fei, Vice Minister, Ministry of Commerce, and the rest of the delegation from the People’s Republic of China (PRC).During the PRC’s last two Trade Policy Reviews, the United States laid out, in frank and direct terms, both the importance of the PRC’s role in the international trading system and the unique and fundamental challenges to that system that the PRC presents.  Today, unfortunately, those challenges not only persist, but are increasing.When the PRC acceded to the WTO in 2001, WTO Members expected that the terms set forth in the PRC’s Protocol of Accession would permanently dismantle existing PRC-based policies and practices that were incompatible with an international trading system expressly based on open, market-oriented policies and would lead to Beijing’s embrace of market-oriented principles.  But more than two decades later, those expectations have not been realized, and it seems clear that the PRC has no inclination to change.  Instead, the PRC has doubled down on its state-led, non-market approach to the economy, to the detriment of workers and businesses in the United States and other countries, including emerging and developing economies.The People’s Republic of China is not the only WTO Member that still operates a non-market economy.  There are a few others.  But what sets the PRC apart from them is that Beijing operates its non-market economy in a “predatory” manner.  That is, because of the size of its economy and the volume of its trade, the PRC is uniquely positioned to be able to use its state-directed approach to the economy to eliminate foreign competition and amass market power.Through state-led industrial plans like Made in China 2025, the PRC targets key industries for domination, both in the PRC-based market and globally, and the full weight of the PRC state is deployed in support of this goal of domination.  It means that foreign companies are not competing against individual PRC companies; they are competing against the PRC state and PRC companies acting in concert.The PRC uses constantly evolving non-market policies and practices to achieve the domination objectives in its industrial plans, including not only massive and pervasive – and often non-transparent – subsidization, but also market access limitations, investment restrictions, forced or pressured technology transfer, state-sponsored cyber theft, preferential treatment for state-owned enterprises and other favored PRC companies, discriminatory regulation, unique national standards, data restrictions, inadequate protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights, the use of competition law enforcement for industrial policy purposes, and unfair labor practices, including forced labor.Through these non-market policies and practices, the PRC directs and enables PRC companies to manufacture excessive amounts of products and sell them at unreasonably low or below-cost prices, particularly in export markets.  Notably, the PRC’s pursuit of these industrial plans does not merely harm other developed economies with mature industries.  It especially harms emerging and developing economies, as too often they cannot successfully develop their own competing industries and, instead, become more dependent on the PRC, something economists call “premature deindustrialization.”Across most industries, Beijing’s state-directed approach to the economy often results in excess capacity and overproduction, leading to a flood of low-priced exports.  We are beginning to see this dynamic play out now in what economists are labeling “China Shock 2.0.”  Faced with an acute crisis in the real estate sector and struggling manufacturers coming out of the COVID pandemic, governments at all levels in the PRC have increased their support for both high-tech and low-tech manufacturers.  These interventions have led to production well in excess of global demand, and with domestic demand remaining weak, a wide range of low-priced manufactured goods are beginning to flood export markets – and the resulting harm will surely be felt by all of us.We also feel compelled to highlight another prevalent practice, which has come to be known as “economic coercion.”  A number of WTO Members have been targeted by Beijing’s “economic coercion,” which takes many forms.  But whatever form it takes, it is simply not the behavior of an economy operating within the international rules-based order.Like other WTO Members, the United States has made extensive efforts to encourage the PRC to comply with and embrace WTO rules and norms and make other market-oriented changes, and today we continue to urge Beijing to do so.  At the same time, we are realistic, as the PRC has shown no interest in pursuing fundamental changes.  As a result, as Ambassador Tai recently explained, “The People’s Republic of China remains the biggest challenge to the international trading system.”n###",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai today released the secondReport on the Operation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) with Respect to Trade in Automotive Goods. The publication of the Report is pursuant to Section 202A(g)(1) of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement Implementation Act (Pub. L. 116-113).“It is crucial that we ensure that this sector continues to thrive in North America, across all three countries, with good-paying jobs, empowered workers, and fair, market-oriented competition, especially as it transitions to new electric vehicle technologies,”said Ambassador Katherine Tai. “With just two years until the mandated six-year review of the USMCA, this report provides an important opportunity to utilize its findings, make adjustments, and fulfill the promise of the USMCA for our three countries.”The 2024Report on the Operation of the USMCA with Respect to Trade in Automotive Goodscan be viewedhere. Additional information, including the first biennial report can be viewedhere.BACKGROUNDThis biennial report, prepared by USTR in consultation with the Interagency Committee on Trade in Automotive Goods, examines the actions taken by auto producers to demonstrate compliance with the USMCA and whether the USMCA’s automotive rules of origin are effective and relevant in light of changing vehicle and production technologies.In the preparation of this report, USTR requested public input from automotive producers, labor organizations, associations, and other stakeholders.The report finds that in the four years since the USMCA’s entry into force, the Agreement has had significantly positive economic impact on the U.S. and North American auto industry, benefitting producers, suppliers, and workers.  The automotive industry continues its unprecedented transition towards a zero-emissions future, while simultaneously preparing for full implementation of the USMCA rules of origin (ROOs) when special flexibilities afforded under alternative staging regimes begin to expire in 2025.  Auto producers have noted that additional flexibilities may be needed due to limitations of nascent domestic electric vehicle and battery manufacturing.  At the same time, other stakeholders have suggested modifications to the automotive rules of origin to better reflect the changing technologies in electric and autonomous vehicles and to incentivize the North American production of those newer components and technologies.The report also finds that some stakeholders would like greater transparency and information about the implementation and enforcement of the ROOs, including with regard to the labor value content requirements, while others identified administrative burdens in demonstrating compliance with the ROOs.USTR and the Interagency Autos Committee will consult and work closely with stakeholders to address these challenges and to find opportunities to continue to enhance the competitiveness of the North American automotive industry and its workers through the USMCA.n###",

    "content": "Publication:The Financial TimesnFrom data to workers’ rights, we need to democratise economic opportunitynDuring the peak of the pandemic, the Financial Times wrote of the need for a new “social contract that benefits everyone” and for radical reforms to reverse “the prevailing policy direction of the last four decades”. Poignantly, the piece noted that, just as the Atlantic Charter and Bretton Woods conference had crystallised during the thick of the second world war, leaders must act today to win the peace.nAs an integral part of economic policy, trade must also be a part of any social contract; it must undergo its own transformation. Here, the Atlantic Charter of 1941 also provides a guidepost. It stated that international economic co-operation is to be pursued “with the object of securing, for all, improved labour standards, economic advancement, and social security”. This is not a call for trickle-down economic policy, but a call for economic policy to serve the interests of working people.nTrade policy has long followed the trickle-down approach that has been so common over the past four decades. But if we recognise that deferring to the market has its limits in ensuring that domestic economic policy benefits working people, we must also recognise its limits to do the same when it comes to trade.nA laissez-faire system has allowed short-term profit-driven businesses to maximise their gains, often by partnering with a non-market autocracy to further that goal. While profits and executive pay soared, workers were left behind. Meanwhile concentrated production emboldened monopolistic behaviour by countries such as China. The American economy has been and remains an open one. That, however, has meant that American workers were particularly exposed to the harms from such behaviour. Communities were devastated as trade policy remained isolated from democratic accountability.nThis is why the Biden-Harris administration’s approach to trade has been to democratise economic opportunity. We are breaking out of the technocrats’ bubble to meet working people where they are, redesigning the incentive structure so that communities are not pitted against each other. For example, for a long time, workers in Ohio or Pennsylvania or Arizona have been set against workers in Mexico, where rights have been unfairly suppressed. This is what happens when we blindly believe that liberalising trade rules leads to a gradual improvement in labour standards as countries grow wealthier through trade flows.nWe are flipping this narrative on its head, using a trade agreement. Through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement’s Rapid Response Labor Mechanism, the US and Mexico have worked together to positively affect the lives of nearly 30,000 workers and their communities in Mexico. That also means many more people in America can compete on a level playing field.nWe are drawing on people’s real experiences to best formulate trade rules that support such collective resilience, including on supply chains. For my office, this is about much more than just the movement of goods — it is about reconfiguring the system so that more people can access economic opportunity and justice. It means reaching out to those that have been traditionally left out of trade discussions — not only inviting them to the table, but then incorporating their voices, so that they can thrive in this new global economy. We are also putting people at the centre of our review of digital trade rules. Countries around the world are figuring out how to protect their citizens’ data, and trade rules must support those efforts.nAmerican companies are strong, innovative, and dynamic. When the playing field is level, they can compete and thrive. But whether in digital trade or other sectors, we must be clear eyed that China is not just a trading partner, but is pursuing global dominance across key economic sectors. President Joe Biden, recognising the need to do more to counter China’s unfair practices, including its cyber theft, recently directed me to increase tariffs on a range of products, including electric vehicles and batteries. These tariffs will defend American workers and businesses, as well as our historic investments. Other countries also have growing concerns about China’s non-market excess capacity and are starting to take steps to address it.nThe stakes are high. As Oxford historian Patricia Clavin has documented, democracies failed to find common ground on international economic issues in the 1930s, with devastating consequences. As we once again confront uncertainty and fear, we must embrace the opportunity to make the world a safer, more equitable place. And we know it is something that we must do together.",

    "content": "Following the fourth meeting of the USMCA/CUSMA/T-MEC (Agreement) Free Trade Commission (FTC) on May 22, 2024, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai, Canadian Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development Mary Ng, and Mexican Secretary of Economy Raquel Buenrostro issued the following joint statement:“Today, the United States, Canada, and Mexico held the fourth meeting of the USMCA/CUSMA/T-MEC FTC in Phoenix, Arizona. The USMCA/CUSMA/T-MEC is a high-standard, high-ambition agreement that promotes the rights of our workers, advances our environmental priorities, and creates new opportunities for our producers. Nearly four years after the Agreement’s entry into force, it continues to strengthen our region’s competitiveness and resilience.”During the meeting, the Ministers reviewed ongoing work to strengthen trilateral cooperation under the Agreement. The Ministers took note of readouts from the Working Group for Cooperation on Agricultural Biotechnology and the Committees on Textiles, Technical Barriers to Trade, Good Regulatory Practices, State-Owned Enterprises and Designated Monopolies, and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises.The Ministers also took stock of trilateral cooperation related to the Agreement’s Sectoral Annexes and led discussions on Inclusive Trade and the Environment, North American Competitiveness, and Cooperation on Prohibiting the Import of Goods Produced with Forced Labor.The Ministers provided guidance for future work under the USMCA/CUSMA/T-MEC and directed the Committees to redouble their efforts to advance the Agreement’s full implementation to help ensure that the North American economy continues to serve as a model for competitiveness and robust, broad-based, and equitable growth. Ministers also agreed to jointly expand their collaboration on issues related to non-market policies and practices of other countries, which undermine the Agreement and harm U.S., Canadian, and Mexican workers, including in the automotive and other sectors.Small and Medium-Sized EnterprisesMinisters reiterated their commitment to promote mechanisms to increase the integration of SMEs into regional and global supply chains. Likewise, it is important to highlight the work of the SME Committee to promote SMEs led by women and Indigenous communities. This has been reflected in the three successful Dialogues that have been held, which demonstrate that this is a valuable space for the exchange of challenges and opportunities to integrate SMEs into North American commerce.Inclusive Trade and the EnvironmentThe Ministers agreed that trade is an important tool to address global environmental challenges and to advance our shared sustainability goals. During the meeting, the Ministers discussed efforts to support environmental cooperation activities, including activities to strengthen the implementation of the USMCA/CUSMA/T-MEC Environment Chapter obligations.The Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to prioritize inclusivity in pursuit of trade and environmental objectives, including through discussion of efforts to promote effective stakeholder engagement as the cornerstone of the upcoming five-year review of the implementation and operation of the Environment Chapter.North American CompetitivenessThe Ministers discussed the important work to fully implement the terms of the USMCA/CUSMA/T-MEC FTC Decision Number 5, which entered into force in February 2023. To further this work, the United States and Canada shared publicly relevant information on their respective internal domestic procedures to coordinate government action and to consult with industries and other non-governmental stakeholders, including workers, most directly impacted by the disruption of North American trade flows in an emergency situation. Recognizing that emergency response work is critical for North American security and competitiveness, the Ministers also signed an addendum to FTC Decision Number 5, updated to include procedures for how the three Parties will respond to specific emergency situations that impact the flow of trade, including procedures for convening extraordinary sessions of the Sub-Committee on Emergency Response.The Ministers also underscored the importance of increasing opportunities for North American workers through workforce development programs. Since 2021, the United States, Canada, and Mexico have hosted four trilateral workforce development forums to highlight innovative school-industry partnerships in key sectors, effective local and state-level partnerships and programs, and best practices in including underserved communities in workforce development programs. The Ministers announced the United States will host a workforce development event in Phoenix later this year to discuss skills and partnerships needed to grow North America’s semiconductor ecosystem.The Ministers also welcomed the recent meeting of the Parties’ investment promotion agencies and office, organized by Canada, which focused on best practices in attracting investment in North America and areas of potential future collaboration.Labor Rights and Cooperation on Prohibiting the Import of Goods Produced with Forced LaborThe Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to uphold workers’ rights as set out in the USMCA/CUSMA/T-MEC, including freedom of association and collective bargaining rights. The Ministers hosted a roundtable with labor stakeholders to hear their perspectives on the importance of advancing an inclusive, worker-centered trade policy.The USMCA/CUSMA/T-MEC commitment to prohibit the importation of goods produced using forced or compulsory labor and its implementation across all three Parties provides an opportunity to make a worldwide impact. The Ministers reiterated their commitment to address forced labor in our supply chains and discussed opportunities for continued sharing of best practices, experiences and lessons learned in relation to combatting forced labor and other forms of labor exploitation.Next StepsDuring the meeting, the Ministers agreed that continued engagement is key to maintaining momentum on implementation and enforcement of the Agreement. The Ministers highlighted that this meeting marks year four on the path to the six-year joint review of the Agreement and underscored the importance of making progress toward full implementation of the Agreement over the next two years. The Parties recognized the foundational role of the USMCA/CUSMA/T-MEC in the North American economy and its promise to improve the wellbeing of all of our citizens, including those who have historically been left behind by trade. The Parties expect to hold a Deputies meeting before the end of this year to assess progress made on the priorities discussed during the meeting.nn###",

    "content": "As Prepared for DeliverynGood morning, everyone.Secretary Buenrostro, Minister Ng, and colleagues from Economia, Global Affairs Canada, and USTR.  It is great to see you, and I want to welcome all of you to the beautiful city of Phoenix.I especially want to thank my team at USTR for organizing this fourth meeting of the USMCA Free Trade Commission.  Thanks so much for all your hard work.Phoenix is one of the largest and most vibrant cities in the United States. If you read about the history of Phoenix and Arizona, you will see references to the “five C’s” that have traditionally underpinned its economy: copper, cattle, cotton, citrus, and climate.These industries are still important here—for workers and businesses.  But you may be more familiar with what we would say is its recent sixth “C” – CHIPS.  And by CHIPS, I mean semiconductors.  Those tiny microcomputers that power so many things in our everyday lives.During the pandemic, we all experienced what can happen when we have a semiconductor shortage.  It was not that long ago, but people tend to forget.  The pandemic exposed how fragile and dispersed our supply chains are, and for certain critical goods, how concentrated they have become in geopolitically fraught areas of the world.This is why Arizona is becoming a hub to develop high-tech industries, including semiconductors.  But this is not just about this state or the United States.  Resilience is a shared North American goal, and the USMCA is central to achieving that vision.I do not need to remind you of the collective challenges we face.  Supply chains is one.  A worsening climate crisis is another.  Addressing unfair, non-market trade policies—and the damage they are inflicting on our working communities—is also paramount.As President Biden says, we are at an inflection point.  But this also presents us with a great opportunity—to use the USMCA as a force for the common good, to benefit more people throughout our societies, and to make our region more resilient and competitive.On supply chains specifically, the USMCA Competitiveness Committee was an early mover with FTC Decision #5, which lays out our shared commitment to mitigate disruption to North American trade during emergency situations.  I look forward to a deeper discussion on that work later today.But you may know that USTR has also been taking a leading role to develop innovative trade tools and strategies to connect trade and other economic policy measures to bolster resilience.This work can feed into our existing work under the USMCA, where we should continue to make this a priority in our trilateral agenda, especially as we see non-market economies pushing into important sectors in our region.  We need to work closely on how best to move forward together.Eliminating forced labor is another area where we have a unique opportunity for partnership, and this is also closely tied to our work on supply chains.As you may know, our Administration has made it a priority to eliminate forced labor from supply chains, and also to stop the importation of goods produced with forced labor.  This is both a moral and economic imperative that we must deliver on, and it is an area where we must do more collectively.  I look forward to the specific session later today dedicated to this topic.Of course, close cooperation does not mean that we agree on everything.  That is only natural amongst partners that in 2022 traded over $1.8 trillion in goods and services.That is why we are here—to talk about how we can use the USMCA to address today’s challenges and prepare us for the future.We all know that the Agreement’s first six-year review is approaching, and each of us have begun to hear from stakeholders about priorities for that review. For our Administration, the priority is making sure that more people—especially workers, their communities, and those that have been historically left behind by trade—can benefit from the Agreement.To get there, trade agreements like ours need to be used and tested.  That means we need to continue to focus on full implementation, monitoring, and enforcement—especially with regard to labor and environment obligations.  This is critical if we want our Agreement to deliver real results for our people.That is why it is important for us to hear directly from our labor stakeholders later today.  And I also look forward to highlighting some of the important work and insights from local tribal communities during our site visit later this afternoon.  I look forward to hearing from our coordinators and the committee leads on their ongoing work.Thank you.n###",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai today released the following statement concerning the statutory review of the tariff actions in the Section 301 investigation of China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation:n“Today, I am following through on my commitment to stand up to the People’s Republic of China’s unfair trade practices by issuing a formal proposal to modify the tariff actions,” saidAmbassador Katherine Tai. “The President has directed me to make substantial tariff increases on targeted, strategic products, and this is an important step to carry out that vision. The President and I will continue to fight for American workers, and for our economic future and national security.”nIn aReportissued last week, the Trade Representative found that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) has not eliminated its technology transfer related acts, policies, and practices, which continue to impose a burden or restriction on U.S. commerce. The Report also found that the PRC has persisted, and in some cases become aggressive, including through cyber intrusions and cybertheft, in its attempts to acquire and absorb foreign technology. Based on these findings, Ambassador Tai recommended a series of actions to President Biden to further encourage the PRC to eliminate its harmful, acts, policies, and practices.nOn May 14, 2024, after considering the advice of the Trade Representative, President Bidendirectedthe Trade Representative to take a number of actions.nIn accordance with President Biden’s direction, Ambassador Tai is issuing a formal proposal in the Federal Register to increase tariffs on specific products in strategic sectors. Thenoticealso establishes the framework for an exclusion process for machinery, and proposes temporary exclusions for 19 tariff lines for solar manufacturing equipment. The notice establishes a 30-day period for public comment on these modifications.nBackgroundIn May 2022, USTR commenced the statutory four-year review process by notifying representatives of domestic industries that benefit from the tariff actions of the possible termination of those actions and of the opportunity for the representatives to request continuation. In September 2022, USTR announced that because requests for continuation were received, the tariff actions had not terminated and USTR would conduct a review of the tariff actions. USTR opened a docket on November 15, 2022, for interested persons to submit comments with respect to a number of considerations concerning the review. USTR received nearly 1,500 comments.As part of the statutory review process, throughout 2023 and early 2024, USTR and the Section 301 Committee (a staff-level body of the USTR-led, interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee) held numerous meetings with agency experts concerning the review and the comments received.Specifically, the Report concludes:nThe Section 301 actions have been effective in encouraging the PRC to take steps toward eliminating some of its technology transfer-related acts, policies, and practices and have reduced some of the exposure of U.S. persons and businesses to these technology transfer-related acts, policies, and practices.The PRC has not eliminated many of its technology transfer-related acts, policies, and practices, which continue to impose a burden or restriction on U.S. commerce. Instead of pursuing fundamental reform, the PRC has persisted, and in some cases become aggressive, including through cyber intrusions and cybertheft, in its attempts to acquire and absorb foreign technology, which further burden or restrict U.S. commerce.Economic analyses generally find that tariffs (particularly PRC retaliation) have had small negative effects on U.S. aggregate economic welfare, positive impacts on U.S. production in the 10 sectors most directly affected by the tariffs, and minimal impacts on economy-wide prices and employment.Negative effects on the United States are particularly associated with retaliatory tariffs that the PRC has applied to U.S. exports.Critically, these analyses examine the tariff actions as isolated policy measures without reference to the policy landscape that may be reinforcing or undermining the effects of the tariffs.Economic analyses, including the principal U.S. Government analysis published by the U.S. International Trade Commission, generally find that the Section 301 tariffs have contributed to reducing U.S. imports of goods from the PRC and increasing imports from alternate sources, including U.S. allies and partners, thereby potentially supporting U.S. supply chain diversification and resilience.n###",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – At the conclusion of the fifth round of negotiations under the United States – Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP), United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for Investment, Trade, and Industry Rebecca Miano renewed their commitment to work to conclude an agreement by the end of the year on a high standard, ambitious STIP that reflects mutually shared goals and values.They agreed that the two sides have made significant progress in several areas, including on anticorruption; micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs); services domestic regulation; and the first tranche of agriculture text. These provisions are designed to facilitate agricultural trade and advance food security; prevent and combat bribery and other forms of corruption; empower MSMEs in both economies; and ensure that service suppliers are treated fairly and in a transparent manner.They also agreed to continue negotiations in other areas with a view to increasing investment, promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth, benefiting workers, and supporting African regional economic integration. These provisions are intended to ensure efficient customs procedures and enhance cooperation on enforcement; promote workers’ rights and protections; advance and support environment and climate change objectives; provide citizens, traders, and other interested persons with greater transparency about regulatory processes; and facilitate agricultural trade and enhance transparency and understanding of the application of science- and risk-based sanitary and phytosanitary measures and sustainable agricultural practices.The two sides recently concluded conceptual discussions on how the STIP can advance the full, equitable, and meaningful participation in international trade and investment of all persons, including women, youth, persons with disabilities, other vulnerable populations, and the African Diaspora. Assistant United States Trade Representative Constance Hamilton and Kenya’s Principal Secretary for Trade Alfred K’Ombudo, who are leading the negotiating teams, also co-chaired a public listening session.After announcing the launch of the STIP negotiations in July 2022, the United States and Kenya began conceptual discussions in Washington, DC, in February 2023 and commenced text-based negotiations in April 2023 in Nairobi, Kenya. The two sides have each hosted subsequent negotiating rounds, including the previous in-person negotiating round held April 2-12, 2024, in Washington, DC.Details on the next negotiating round will be shared at a later date.n###",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai today released the following statement concerning the statutory review of the tariff actions in the Section 301 investigation of China’s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation:“After thorough review of the statutory report on Section 301 tariffs, and having considered my advice, President Biden is directing me to take further action to encourage the elimination of the People’s Republic of China’s unfair technology transfer-related policies and practices that continue to burden U.S. commerce and harm American workers and businesses,”said Ambassador Katherine Tai.“As the President recognizes in his memorandum, while the tariffs have been effective in encouraging the PRC to take some steps to address the issues identified in the Section 301 investigation, further action is required.“In light of President Biden’s direction, I will be proposing modifications to the China tariffs under Section 301 to confront the PRC’s unfair policies and practices. From the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration, I have been committed to using every lever of my office to promote American jobs and investments, and these recommendations are no different. Today, we serve our statutory goal to stop the PRC’s harmful technology transfer-related acts, policies, and practices, including its cyber intrusions and cyber theft. I take this charge seriously, and I will continue to work with my partners across sectors to ensure any action complements the Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to expand opportunities for American workers and manufacturers.”The Section 301 statute directs that the four-year review includes a consideration of: the effectiveness of the tariff actions in achieving the objective of the investigation; other actions that could be taken; and the overall effects of the tariff actions on the U.S. economy. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative’s (USTR)Reportaddresses the statutory elements of the review, suggests modifications to strengthen the actions, and makes certain recommendations.To encourage further elimination of the PRC’s technology transfer-related acts, policies, and practices, Ambassador Tai has recommended that products from the PRC currently subject to Section 301 tariffs should remain. Additionally, in light of the increased burden on U.S. commerce, President Biden is directing Ambassador Tai to take action to add or increase tariffs for certain products. As the Report details, Ambassador Tai will propose the following modifications in strategic sectors:nnThe Report also makes recommendations for: (1) establishing an exclusion process targeting machinery used in domestic manufacturing, including proposals for 19 exclusions for certain solar manufacturing equipment; (2) allocating additional funds to United States Customs and Border Protection for greater enforcement of Section 301 actions; (3) greater collaboration and cooperation between private companies and government authorities to combat state-sponsored technology theft; and (4) continuing to assess approaches to support diversification of supply chains to enhance our own supply chain resilience.President Biden is also directing Ambassador Tai to establish an exclusion process for machinery used in domestic manufacturing and to prioritize, in particular, exclusions for certain solar manufacturing equipment.Next week, USTR will issue a Federal Register notice announcing procedures for interested persons to comment on the proposed modifications and information concerning an exclusion process for machinery used in domestic manufacturing.BackgroundIn May 2022, USTR commenced the statutory four-year review process by notifying representatives of domestic industries that benefit from the tariff actions of the possible termination of those actions and of the opportunity for the representatives to request continuation.  In September 2022, USTR announced that because requests for continuation were received, the tariff actions had not terminated and USTR would conduct a review of the tariff actions.  USTR opened a docket on November 15, 2022, for interested persons to submit comments with respect to a number of considerations concerning the review.  USTR received nearly 1,500 comments.As part of the statutory review process, throughout 2023 and early 2024, USTR and the Section 301 Committee (a staff-level body of the USTR-led, interagency Trade Policy Staff Committee) held numerous meetings with agency experts concerning the review and the comments received.Specifically, the Report concludes:nn###",

    "content": "As DeliverednGood evening, everyone. It’s wonderful to see you. Thank you, Minister Gan, for welcoming us tonight, and to our hosts as well, Ambassador Kaplan. And many, many thanks to the Singapore Embassy and the US-ASEAN Business Council for gathering us together to celebrate this important milestone.One thing I’m just going to remark on is, those of us in the front here, we promise that we don’t bite so I welcome you to come a little closer. Although I also know that the food and the drink are in the back. That’s always an attraction and usually, you know, the first thing you want to track when you come in to one of these rooms.I also want to mention that, in the United States, our Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month is just right around the corner, in a couple of days. It starts in May.  So, in that context, I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the thoughtful, truly thoughtful contributions of the Singaporean Diaspora here in the United States over the years to make our bilateral relationship that much more rich and meaningful.Minister Gan, you’ll recall that I visited Singapore for the very first time as the U.S. Trade Representative, actually the first time I ever visited Singapore, a little more than two years ago.  That was a really important and wonderful trip, and I met with you and Prime Minister Lee to discuss how we can work together to address many of the emerging trade issues that we’re facing in the world. And those are issues that have certainly proliferated since then.From those conversations, it was clear to me that we have a truly solid foundation to build upon.You and your government have demonstrated true partnership every step along the way, and I really want to express my deep appreciation for them.As many of you know, the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement was our first FTA with an Asian nation, which has been noted already tonight. We signed the FTA in 2003, and it entered into force on January 1, 2004, so this is the twentieth anniversary.I also wanted to note that, in addition to the statistics that I’m going to recount that will complement the ones that have been noted before—I also while I was standing here looked at the Congressional vote count for the Singapore FTA. Because I know that it passed Congress with flying colors. And it was 63% in the House, 67% in the Senate.And I wanted to reflect on that because I think that that is actually a really important indicator of the robust support for this particular partnership, and how that support remains very durable to this day.20 years, of course, is a long time for anything. I think that if the FTA were an American, it would be able to drive, and vote, and it’s almost, almost, ready to drink.For the last two decades, this agreement has been such an important part of our bilateral economic relationship and a real testament to the strong trade and investment ties between our two countries.Here are some of the numbers I promised you.Our bilateral trade has gone from $40 billion in 2003 to over $120 billion in 2022, and as you noted, supporting more than 225,000 jobs here in the United States.The United States is the leading source of foreign direct investment for Singapore at over $300 billion, more than our investments in Japan, Korea, and the People’s Republic of China, combined.But more importantly, it was evident to me throughout my first visit – and the ones that have come after –we share common values, and a vision for how we can adapt to new changes and challenges developing right before our eyes.This is because we know that our economies—while we talk about our economies in terms of numbers all the time—that our economies are more than just numbers.Our economies are made up of our people—working people and their communities.And I’ll say something else I learned by visiting Singapore, was to see an incredibly beautiful and thoughtful architecture throughout your city-state. Beautiful, green, high tech, and also as was explained to me, how Singapore the government has thought through at very, very deep levels the diversity in your population and how to reflect that in the places where people live.That point of intentionality around maintaining the integrity of community in Singapore is something that I have been very inspired by since that first visit.What we would like to do is to work together in these next 20 years to ensure that our economic relationship continues to deliver for our people and to deliver more equitable and more sustainable outcomes for those people.To democratize economic opportunity in our countries. To make sure that all parts of our societies can enjoy the benefits of this increased trade and enhanced relationship.Now the world economy is very different today than when we signed our FTA, and it will be very different two decades from now.Let’s not be quick to forget the disruptions and shocks we all experienced through the pandemic.  We’re also grappling with the reality of unfair trade practices and economic coercion.In parallel with these tensions, working and underserved communities across our societies are more acutely feeling a sense of economic insecurity.And in this new reality, we need to see the world as it is as fellow democracies. Our traditional FTA approach, which saw a lot of success in this relationship, it has focused on maximum liberalization and efficiency, and it has certainly benefitted sectors of our economies. But we also have to acknowledge that it has hurt other sectors of certainly our economy.And this is why we feel so keenly right now the need for a new approach, a new way of navigating the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead and doing that together with some of our closest partners.We can take our wins and make them better—to be more far reaching, more equitable, and as durable as this FTA has proven to be. We can take the shortfalls and we can improve upon those. There are ways to make trade work for more people, without pitting parts of our economies against others.And so we are forging ahead. To build our middle classes together. To shape a world that we can be proud to hand off to the next generation.And this is something new; it is bold and let me be the first to admit, it is not easy. But Singapore has been and will continue to be a critical partner as we define the next era of trade and economic policy.In February, Minister Gan and I were in Abu Dhabi together for the WTO’s 13thMinisterial Conference, along with many of our colleagues.And, one of these days perhaps we can all have a therapy session about it.But for today let me just recall that a lot of the conversation there was centered around how we can deliver better results for working people around the world, and how we can ensure greater economic resiliency for more communities, especially for developing countries.And here again I want to acknowledge and recognize Singapore’s similar role as a member of ASEAN to speak up for the developing members of ASEAN. And to remind us about the importance of a more inclusive approach to international economic relations.I can’t tell you how glad I am to have an ally like Minister Gan in the room for those discussions in Abu Dhabi.  It really is a testament to the depth of our bilateral relationship and the trust that you and I have developed over the years.And this of course also applies to the work we’ve been doing on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity, or as we’ve been calling it, the IPEF.I know that everyone in this room has invested a lot in the IPEF and with respect to the trade pillar in particular. And I’d like to thank all of you for your support. And I want to let you know that in the months and in the years ahead, we have more work to do.We’re tremendously proud of what we have accomplished. And we’re looking forward to unveiling and sharing what we’ve accomplished with everyone around the world.The discussions that we’ve been engaged in are hard, precisely because the work is so consequential. But I am really optimistic because of partners like Singapore. And the United States is committed to working with Singapore and our other partners on this because we understand what’s at stake.Our Administration’s worker-centered trade policy can be summed up like this—trade is really about human beings, the human beings who comprise our economies, and it needs to address the needs of everyday people, no matter where you live and whether you have a college degree or not.So this is deeper than business to business ties—although those are very important—this is about people to people ties, it is about values to values. It’s about what we stand for, and what we want our collective world to look like.Our FTA has been a good starting point for both of our countries, and I look forward to seeing Minister Gan again tomorrow morning when we convene a Joint Committee Meeting to go through all of the issues that our teams have been working on diligently throughout the year.We’ll remain focused on the work ahead to drive more inclusive, sustainable economic growth for all our people—and to shape the global trading system together, for the better.I also wanted to note what a privilege and honor it was to have the chance to meet Prime Minister Lee on my first visit to Singapore. The Prime Minister has been an invaluable partner for the United States over the years. We have appreciated the deepening of U.S.-Singapore ties during his tenure, including the implementation of our FTA.I also wanted to share with all of you that the Prime Minister is very well known for being a big thinker and a very deep thinker. And in the opportunity I had to sit down with him, we talked about U.S. trade policy today.And he, as many people in the last three plus years has spent time probing with me, exactly what a worker-centered trade policy means. And it was because of meetings with you, Minister, and your fellow ministers within the administration in Singapore, that I had the opportunity to explain to Prime Minister Lee that Singapore has this very strong tradition of tripartism, where it’s the government coming together with the economy represented by employers and also by employees and workers.And that this is the structure through which economic policy, domestic and internationally, really is made within Singapore.And that one way of understanding that worker-centered trade policy that we’re advancing under President Biden is the building out of a kind of a tripartism within our system in terms of how we approach trade.And I really am tremendously grateful for the opportunity to have that conversation with Prime Minister Lee. And to have that meeting of the minds, and to have his and his administration’s support for everything we have done together.In the coming months, the United States and USTR look forward to working with Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and the new leadership team.Thank you again for welcoming us, and enjoy the rest of your evening, and there’s one more thing I want to share with you about my trip to Singapore—that it is the Singaporeans who treated me to my first taste of durian.I believe there are photographs and possibly even video, of this incredible opportunity to broaden my horizons.I’m always happy to say—and I have been told that you need to try durian. If at first, you don’t acquire the taste—that repeating the experience about 25 more times would do it. I think I’ve got maybe 23 more times to do it and I know that Singapore will help me along on this journey as well.Thank you so much.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – Today at 10:00 AM ET, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai will testify before the Senate Committee on Finance on President Biden’s 2024Trade Policy Agenda. Ambassador Tai will highlight how the Biden-Harris Administration’s trade agenda is supporting economic growth from the middle out and the bottom up by empowering workers both at home and abroad, rebuilding American manufacturing, and strengthening the resilience of U.S. supply chains.nThe live webcast will be accessible on the Senate Finance Committeewebsite.The full text of Ambassador Tai's written testimony is below:nChairman Wyden, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the Committee.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the President’s Trade Policy Agenda.  Congress is our constitutional partner on trade, and I am delighted to be here to discuss our agenda and hear your views.President Biden summed it up during his State of the Union Address last month—America is writing the greatest comeback story never told.Our Administration’s economic plan is leading our country in the strongest economic recovery amongst all developed nations.  More importantly, we are doing so in a way that democratizes economic opportunity for more people.We have shifted the conversation from focusing on the bigs to including and championing the interests of the smalls and the mediums.  From trickle down to bottom up.  From people as consumers only to people as workers also.We are reorienting the economic system to strengthen the middle class.The President’s trade agenda is critical to this reorientation.  In the past, trade policy primarily focused on and benefitted the largest stakeholders, but we are flipping that top-down approach on its head.Trade is a tool to give all Americans a fair shot and ensure that our system is set up for inclusive and durable growth.  Promoting healthy competition is critical to achieving this goal.  This is why I am honored to serve as a member of the White House Competition Council, to align our trade agenda with our domestic economic tools to advance fair competition for more people.It is also a critical tool for building robust supply chains that lower costs for American families, a goal I work to advance as a member of the President’s Council on Supply Chain Resilience.Asking old tools to solve new challenges—like economic insecurity, fragile supply chains, and a worsening climate crisis—is destined to fail.  We must question assumptions, revisit norms, and think creatively and strategically.In this new era, we increasingly measure success and progress by the degree to which we are delivering real benefits to more Americans across our society—no matter where you live or whether you have a college degree.Our approach is one that addresses and advances the interests of all parts of our economy and does not pit Americans against Americans.  Let me give you some examples of what middle-out, bottom-up trade policy looks like.nEmpowering Workers Through TradeFirst, we are using trade to empower workers, because they are the backbone of our economy.  Their success is our success.We are incentivizing a race to the top so that we are not pitting our workers against those in other countries and regions.  Fellow trade ministers tell me that they too want to build their economies from the middle out, and enacting and maintaining high labor standards is key.This is why the United States has prioritized strong labor commitments in our ongoing trade initiatives, including in our negotiations with Kenya and Taiwan.As part of this process, USTR has consulted extensively with labor stakeholders, in addition to the business community.  We will continue to work with our trading partners and with you to ensure that our trade agreements work for workers.This is also why we are using innovative tools with our trading partners to address harmful practices, such as forced labor.  Our work with Japan through the Task Force on the Promotion of Human Rights and International Labor Standards in Supply Chains is one example.This is a part of our Administration’s broader strategy to fight for workers’ rights around the world, including through the first-ever Presidential Memorandum outlining our commitment to worker rights globally, signed by President Biden last November.Advancing workers’ rights abroad also strengthens workers here at home.  This is possible when we are not pitting our working communities against each other, but instead allowing them to compete fairly and thrive in this global economy.  This is what it looks like to align our domestic and foreign economic priorities—a foreign policy for the middle class.At a press conference in San Francisco on the launch of the Memorandum, I had the privilege to meet Rudy Gonzalez, Secretary-Treasurer of the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council.  He spoke with such passion and conviction on why our approach is important to real, working people.It is because of friends like Rudy and his colleagues that we are also focused on enforcing the labor provisions in agreements we already have.  Trade agreements are not trophies to admire on shelves—they are tools to get us results.  The United States – Mexico – Canada Agreement (USMCA) is a prime example.When I worked for the Ways & Means Committee, I worked with many of you to create the USMCA’s Rapid Response Labor Mechanism (RRM), and I want to share what it is doing for working people.Since 2021, the United States has sought Mexico’s review under the RRM 22 times at facilities that span various industries, including automotive, garments, mining, and services.These cases have so far directly benefited 30,000 workers, provided five million dollars in backpay and benefits to workers, ensured wrongly terminated workers were reinstated, and helped secure free and fair elections in which workers selected independent unions to represent them.Last July, I participated in a labor stakeholder forum on the margins of a USMCA Free Trade Commission (FTC) meeting in Mexico.  There, I met Juan Gerardo Castor Puentes, a special delegate for the Mexican Workers’ League.It is a union that represents garment workers at a factory near the Coahuila-Texas border.  He shared with me how important it was for governments to work together to fight for workers and their interests—how doing so is making a real positive impact on people’s daily lives.This not only affects workers in Mexico, it also empowers U.S. workers by reducing the incentive to unfairly ship jobs overseas.There are many success stories to choose from, but I want to highlight the Teksid facility in Frontera, Mexico.In that case, the United States requested Mexico’s review of whether workers at the facility were being threatened or coerced into choosing a particular union, and whether workers were being subject to a state-level collective bargaining agreement that was inferior to a federal-level collective bargaining agreement.  The company was also refusing to recognize the independent union that held the right to represent workers at the facility.As a result of the RRM, 36 workers who had been wrongfully terminated were reinstated and given backpay.  The independent union was given access to the facility and even paid dues that were previously withheld from workers’ pay.Shortly after the case was closed, the independent union negotiated additional benefits for workers, including a nine percent wage increase and a 6.8 percent increase in the overall value of non-wage benefits, as well as an increase in vacation days, bonuses, compliance with required overtime pay, and improvements to working conditions to address work-related injuries.This is real positive change for these workers in Mexico, but also helps ensure that the good-paying jobs our Administration is creating stays here, in our communities.This is how we are building up our working communities and middle classes together, giving them a fair shot to thrive in this global economy.nEnforcing Trade Agreements for a Level Playing FieldThis is why enforcing the trade rules we have continues to be a priority this year for the Administration.  We will continue to level the playing field for American workers and businesses.  We are vigorously enforcing our trade agreements, defending American jobs, and making sure more people enjoy the benefits of trade.For the USMCA, this extends to the interests and rights of our farmers and agricultural producers.I know the agricultural biotechnology concerns with Mexico are important to our farmers, especially our corn producers.  Last August, we established a dispute settlement panel under the USMCA.  We are working to resolve our concerns and help ensure that American farmers can continue to access the Mexican market and use innovative tools to respond to climate and food security challenges.I also know that many of you are concerned that Mexico is undermining American companies and U.S.-produced energy in favor of Mexico’s state-owned utility and oil and gas company.  We launched dispute settlement consultations under USMCA with Mexico to address those concerns and continue engagement with our stakeholders on developments.On Canada dairy, the United States won a USMCA dispute on Canada’s tariff rate quota allocation measures.  However, Canada’s revised policies did not fix the problem for U.S. dairy farmers, and we will continue to work with Canada to resolve our dairy industry’s concerns.We have also activated the tools for environmental enforcement under the USMCA by engaging in consultations with Mexico relating to the protection of the critically endangered vaquita porpoise, the prevention of illegal fishing, and trafficking of totoaba fish.I also want to note that, last year, the United States prevailed at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the cases against the retaliatory tariffs the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Türkiye illegally imposed in response to the U.S. Section 232 national security actions on steel and aluminum.These matters are a priority for USTR this year, and enforcement is one way we are fighting for American farmers, ranchers, producers, workers, and businesses.We are also working tirelessly with trading partners to open markets for hardworking American families and communities—especially our rural communities—to get more wins.nWins for U.S. Agriculture and Rural CommunitiesWe signed an agreement with the EU to modify tariff rate quota (TRQ) allocations on several important U.S. products, including rice, wheat, and corn.We revised the beef safeguard mechanism under the U.S. – Japan Trade agreement, to allow U.S. beef exporters to more reliably meet Japan’s growing demand for high-quality beef.  In 2023, U.S. beef and beef product exports to Japan were $1.8 billion, accounting for more than 46 percent of Japan’s total beef and beef product market.We are shipping more fresh potatoes to Mexico now, beyond the previous limit of a 26-kilometer zone along the U.S.-Mexico border.  U.S. fresh potato exports to Mexico, our largest export market, grew from $82.7 million in 2022 to $117.4 million in 2023. This benefits U.S. potato growers from Idaho to Maine.We also got major wins for our poultry producers—South Africa lifted restrictions on U.S. poultry and poultry products, and we reopened the Colombian market for U.S. poultry and egg products.Specifically, let me highlight what we did to open the Indian market for our exports.Last June, India and the United States terminated six WTO disputes, and India agreed to remove retaliatory tariffs on several U.S. products.This means improved access for chickpeas, lentils, almonds, walnuts, and apples benefiting farmers across the country, including in Michigan, Oregon, and Washington.Additionally, in September, India and the United States resolved our final outstanding WTO dispute, and India agreed to reduce tariffs on several U.S. products.This means more market access for turkey, duck, blueberries, and cranberries benefiting farmers in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.We also worked with Japan to implement a new biofuels policy that will allow the United States to capture up to 100 percent of Japan’s on-road ethanol market.I know this is important to many of you.  Under this policy, exports of U.S. ethanol could increase by over 80 million gallons annually, representing an additional $150-200 million in exports each year.  This is an important win for our producers in Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota.U.S. agricultural exports totaled $174.9 billion in 2023, and our Administration has won over $21 billion worth of new agricultural market access in the last three years.However, this is more than just numbers.  It is about people, their livelihoods, and their communities.People like the first-generation farmer I met in Rowesville, South Carolina.  I met him last December together with Congressman Clyburn at his farm where he grows corn, soybeans, cotton, and small grains.Families growing almonds, like one my Chief Agricultural Negotiator, Doug McKalip, visited in the Central Valley of California last fall.This family was impacted by India’s retaliatory tariffs imposed in 2019, limiting their access to a vital market for their operation.  We removed those tariffs and provided more economic certainty for this family and many others.We are working hard in our efforts to not leave anyone behind.  We are making sure that Americans do not have to abandon their hometowns to find opportunity.nMaking Trade Work for All AmericansTrade should work for all Americans.  This is why we are taking unprecedented steps to incorporate more voices into trade policymaking.Just as you stay connected with the constituents in your states, I have travelled around the country to hear from workers, farmers, and small businesses, and Tribal leaders to learn how trade affects them.I have also made it a priority to meet with a wide range of stakeholders to ensure their views inform our work, including civil society and labor leaders.I know this approach may be surprising to some, but this should and must be the norm moving forward—because my job is to represent the entirety of the United States, not just those who can afford Washington lobbyists.We need to deliver more equitable, fairer outcomes for more Americans.  If we want different results, we need different inputs—from more people across our society.This consultation includes Congress and this Committee.Like our stakeholders, there is a wide range of views in Congress on trade.  Over the last few years, I have welcomed all of your views, and I truly value the various perspectives I hear from Congress.  Moving forward, I will continue partnering with you as we carry out our agenda.Pursuing the interests of all Americans is a clear mandate and vision in the President’s Trade Policy Agenda, and we are placing utmost importance on this work this year.We also know that we need more and better data to informing our work.  This is why USTR is continuing to work with the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and we requested that the USITC repeat the distributional effects investigation every three years for the next 15 years.This is critical for policymakers, researchers, and the public to monitor and ensure progress in assessing the distributional effects of trade policy on U.S. workers.  Better input, for better output.We are also institutionalizing the principles of fairness and equity in our negotiations and regional engagements.For the first time, we have partnered on inclusivity chapters in our trade negotiations, including those with Kenya.  We are also meeting with a broad base of stakeholders to gather input, such as the African Diaspora, and women, youth, and civil rights organizations.During our Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) host year, I was proud to host first-ever minister-level dialogues with Labor and Indigenous leaders.We also announced during APEC that the United States is exploring observership in the Indigenous Peoples Economic and Trade Cooperation Arrangement, or the IPETCA.This is a direct result of our annual Tribal consultations and engagements with Indigenous leaders and communities, and this will be a cornerstone of our work going forward in APEC and in other fora.This includes the WTO, where, during the Thirteenth Ministerial Conference (MC13) in February, U.S. leadership was reflected in the effort of ministers holding a first-ever discussion specifically on how the WTO can help foster better outcomes for more people.nTransforming the WTOThis is part of our overall effort to make the WTO more responsive and effective.Our Administration is working with other WTO Members on a reform agenda that reflects priorities of our worker-centered approach—improving labor standards, protecting our planet, and advancing shared prosperity.MC13 was an important milestone to gauge our progress to date, and we announced several important outcomes.We made more progress on dispute settlement reform in the last year than we did in the last several decades.We extended the e-commerce moratorium, which was not a forgone conclusion.We also announced significant development outcomes.We ensured that Members graduating from the least developed countries (LDC) category can continue a smooth transition.  We agreed to support their capacity to effectively utilize the Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, and we supported a work program for small and vulnerable economies.We also agreed to hold dedicated sessions on issues important to land-locked developing countries.Our discussions in Abu Dhabi highlighted that developing economies, both large and small, are having important debates over what rules and policies best serve their interests.  This includes issues such as inclusivity, sustainable development, and the need for our trade policies to be flexible to allow WTO Members to manage current global challenges.While MC13 is over, our work at the WTO continues, and our Administration remains committed to working with all WTO Members to develop a common agenda that allows all of us to have our priorities reflected.nCollaborating with Trading PartnersWhat we are trying to do in Geneva is reshaping the global trading system for the better, for the future, for the people.  And those are the goals of our regional and bilateral trade initiatives as well.We are making significant progress with Taiwan.Last June, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) signed the first agreement under the United States – Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade.  This was less than a year after we announced the negotiating mandate in August 2022.The first agreement focuses on economically meaningful areas to build our middle classes together.For example, small business owners tell me that tariffs are not the primary reason they cannot export more of their products—in many cases, it is because of the red tape.So, the first agreement with Taiwan includes commitments on simplifying customs procedures and making rulemaking processes more transparent, among other issues.  It also includes specific provisions to help SMEs compete and thrive, including addressing corruption.Furthering these negotiations with Taiwan is a high priority for USTR this year.We are making progress on the U.S. – Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) as well.  Our teams recently wrapped up a third negotiating round.The United States has tabled text on agriculture, anticorruption, SMEs, and services domestic regulation.Together, we are working closely to deliver real benefits to our people and so that the STIP can serve as a model for engagement with other willing countries on the African continent—all while respecting the priority of integration among African countries themselves.An important part of these negotiations is to make sure that any trade deal incentivizes a race to the top, for our people and for our planet.  This is why we have tabled strong text on labor rights and the environment in these discussions, and also in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).Trade deals take time, but our team made more progress in the last year than what would typically take years to complete.I am incredibly proud of my team for what we have accomplished.  We are continuing forward with a new and innovative approach to trade, designed to create durable and sustainable economic growth.This also applies to our work with African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) partners and in our planning for the next AGOA Forum later this year.I met incredible workers, small business owners, and entrepreneurs when I was in Johannesburg for the AGOA Forum last November.  AGOA has helped Africa grow its extraordinary economic potential over the last two decades.Its renewal is important to continue to bring real change to people across the continent, and our Administration fully supports renewal beyond 2025.  However, we must also seize this opportunity to make AGOA better, to improve utilization rates, and to explore other trade tools to complement our AGOA relationship.nPromoting Supply Chain Resilience Through TradeIncreasingly, we are seeing that a sense of growing economic insecurity is shared by different communities across continents, and people everywhere felt this more acutely during the pandemic.Lives and livelihoods, homes and communities were disrupted.  This is why reducing dependencies and vulnerabilities and strengthening supply chains is a major priority for USTR this year, which informs our work as part of the President’s Council on Supply Chain Resilience.Resilient supply chains also reduce opportunities for economic coercion and enhance our economic security.  They provide a range of sourcing options; adapt, rebound, and recover with agility following shocks; uphold labor rights and environmental protections; and strengthen the U.S. manufacturing base and workforce.We have been focused on this topic in various fora, including the G7, G20, APEC, and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  This also includes our work through the Trade Track under the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, where a lot of our efforts will focus on supply chain resilience.But to continue our work to develop innovative trade tools and strategies for connecting trade and other economic policy measures to advance supply chain resilience, we published a Federal Register notice last month.This will allow USTR to draw upon various perspectives and experiences to get a more granular understanding of the challenges and to identify potential policy solutions.We are integrating trade tools with domestic economic measures to position U.S. manufacturing and services for continued leadership and competitiveness.  We are also collaborating with trading partners and allies to incentivize a race to the top through stronger coordination and alignment on labor and environmental protections within trusted networks.I was in Burlington, North Carolina a few weeks ago, and met with the owners and workers of Glen Raven, a family-owned fabrics and textiles company.  I heard first-hand how important it is for us to pursue resilience over efficiency, for our workers and businesses.I also visited the Marsh Furniture Company, a family-owned cabinet manufacturer in High Point, North Carolina.  We talked about the company’s rich, 100-year history, and why it is critical to address unfair practices by the PRC and other economies.nStanding up to the PRC’s Unfair Economic Practices and Fighting for Fair CompetitionAt its core, this is about giving everyone a fair shot.However, that is not possible when countries like the PRC continue to use non-market policies and practices to dominate industries. That dominance is what enables the PRC to coerce other economies.The PRC’s unfair policies and practices have devastated many working communities and industries across our country, including many in your states.Steel, aluminum, solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, and critical minerals—just to name a few.The PRC also uses unfair policies and practices to concentrate production of certain goods in the PRC, which undermines supply chain resilience and harms consumers that, in the long run, are deprived of the innovation and choice that fair competition would produce.As the President said during his State of the Union Address, this Administration will continue to stand up to China’s unfair, non-market policies and practices.  And we are doing so with like-minded partners and allies, as you saw in the Joint Declaration we issued last June with Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.We have seen the PRC create dependencies and vulnerabilities in multiple sectors, harming American workers and businesses and creating real risks for our supply chains.This is why we are taking a serious look at how our existing tools are addressing this problem, including through our four-year review of the China Section 301 tariffs.This is also why, after close review of the Section 301 petition I received from five national labor unions, I have initiated a full and thorough investigation of the PRC’s longstanding efforts to dominate the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. The unions’ petition raises serious concerns about harms to U.S. workers, the shipbuilding industry, and U.S. resilience.Our economic relationship with the PRC is complex, and as the President said, we want competition with China, not conflict.But the competition must be fair, and USTR and the Biden-Harris Administration are fighting every day to put working families first, rebuild American manufacturing, and strengthen our supply chains.We’re using trade to give everyone a fair shot.  That means creating incentives that are more than lower costs; raising labor and environmental standards; and pursuing resiliency.USTR will remain focused this year on developing innovative trade tools and strategies for connecting trade and other economic policy measures to advance these goals.  I want to thank my USTR team, serving in Washington, DC, and around the world, for their unwavering devotion and determination to serve all of America.I think we all agree that our economic system, including trade, should strengthen the middle class.  I look forward to continuing our partnership through regular briefings with you and your staff, as we have done for the last three years.Thank you.n###",

Ambassador Tai will highlight how the Biden-Harris Administration’s trade agenda is supporting economic growth from the middle out and the bottom up by empowering workers both at home and abroad, rebuilding American manufacturing, and strengthening the resilience of U.S. supply chains.nThe live webcast will be accessible on the House Ways & Means Committeewebsite.The full text of Ambassador Tai's written testimony is below:nChairman Smith, Ranking Member Neal, and Members of the Committee.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the President’s Trade Policy Agenda.  Congress is our constitutional partner on trade, and I am delighted to be here to discuss our agenda and hear your views.President Biden summed it up during his State of the Union Address last month—America is writing the greatest comeback story never told.Our Administration’s economic plan is leading our country in the strongest economic recovery amongst all developed nations.  More importantly, we are doing so in a way that democratizes economic opportunity for more people.We have shifted the conversation from focusing on the bigs to including and championing the interests of the smalls and the mediums.  From trickle down to bottom up.  From people as consumers only to people as workers also.We are reorienting the economic system to strengthen the middle class.The President’s trade agenda is critical to this reorientation.  In the past, trade policy primarily focused on and benefitted the largest stakeholders, but we are flipping that top-down approach on its head.Trade is a tool to give all Americans a fair shot and ensure that our system is set up for inclusive and durable growth. Promoting healthy competition is critical to achieving this goal. This is why I am honored to serve as a member of the White House Competition Council, to align our trade agenda with our domestic economic tools to advance fair competition for more people.It is also a critical tool for building robust supply chains that lower costs for American families, a goal I work to advance as a member of the President’s Council on Supply Chain Resilience.Asking old tools to solve new challenges—like economic insecurity, fragile supply chains, and a worsening climate crisis—is destined to fail.  We must question assumptions, revisit norms, and think creatively and strategically.In this new era, we increasingly measure success and progress by the degree to which we are delivering real benefits to more Americans across our society—no matter where you live or whether you have a college degree.Our approach is one that addresses and advances the interests of all parts of our economy and does not pit Americans against Americans.  Let me give you some examples of what middle-out, bottom-up trade policy looks like.Empowering Workers Through TradeFirst, we are using trade to empower workers, because they are the backbone of our economy.  Their success is our success.We are incentivizing a race to the top so that we are not pitting our workers against those in other countries and regions.  Fellow trade ministers tell me that they too want to build their economies from the middle out, and enacting and maintaining high labor standards is key.This is why the United States has prioritized strong labor commitments in our ongoing trade initiatives, including in our negotiations with Kenya and Taiwan.As part of this process, USTR has consulted extensively with labor stakeholders, in addition to the business community.  We will continue to work with our trading partners and with you to ensure that our trade agreements work for workers.This is also why we are using innovative tools with our trading partners to address harmful practices, such as forced labor.  Our work with Japan through the Task Force on the Promotion of Human Rights and International Labor Standards in Supply Chains is one example.This is a part of our Administration’s broader strategy to fight for workers’ rights around the world, including through the first-ever Presidential Memorandum outlining our commitment to worker rights globally, signed by President Biden last November.Advancing workers’ rights abroad also strengthens workers here at home.  This is possible when we are not pitting our working communities against each other, but instead allowing them to compete fairly and thrive in this global economy.  This is what it looks like to align our domestic and foreign economic priorities—a foreign policy for the middle class.At a press conference in San Francisco on the launch of the Memorandum, I had the privilege to meet Rudy Gonzalez, Secretary-Treasurer of the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council.  He spoke with such passion and conviction on why our approach is important to real, working people.It is because of friends like Rudy and his colleagues that we are also focused on enforcing the labor provisions in agreements we already have.  Trade agreements are not trophies to admire on shelves—they are tools to get us results.  The United States – Mexico – Canada Agreement is a prime example.When I worked for the Ways & Means Committee, I worked with many of you to create the USMCA’s Rapid Response Labor Mechanism, and I want to share what it is doing for working people.Since 2021, the United States has sought Mexico’s review under the RRM 22 times at facilities that span various industries, including automotive, garments, mining, and services.These cases have so far directly benefited 30,000 workers, provided five million dollars in backpay and benefits to workers, ensured wrongly terminated workers were reinstated, and helped secure free and fair elections in which workers selected independent unions to represent them.Last July, I participated in a labor stakeholder forum on the margins of a USMCA free Trade Commission (FTC) meeting in Mexico.  There, I met Juan Gerardo Castor Puentes, a special delegate for the Mexican Workers’ League.It is a union that represents garment workers at a factory near the Coahuila-Texas border.  He shared with me how important it was for governments to work together to fight for workers and their interests—how doing so is making a real positive impact on people’s daily lives.This not only affects workers in Mexico, it also empowers U.S. workers by reducing the incentive to unfairly ship jobs overseas.There are many success stories to choose from, but I want to highlight the Teksid facility in Frontera, Mexico.In that case, the United States requested Mexico’s review of whether workers at the facility were being threatened or coerced into choosing a particular union, and whether workers were being subject to a state-level collective bargaining agreement that was inferior to a federal-level collective bargaining agreement.  The company was also refusing to recognize the independent union that held the right to represent workers at the facility.As a result of the RRM, 36 workers who had been wrongfully terminated were reinstated and given backpay.  The independent union was given access to the facility and even paid dues that were previously withheld from workers’ pay.Shortly after the case was closed, the independent union negotiated additional benefits for workers, including a nine percent wage increase and a 6.8 percent increase in the overall value of non-wage benefits, as well as an increase in vacation days, bonuses, compliance with required overtime pay, and improvements to working conditions to address work-related injuries.This is real positive change for these workers in Mexico, but also helps ensure that the good-paying jobs our Administration is creating stays here, in our communities.This is how we are building up our working communities and middle classes together, giving them a fair shot to thrive in this global economy.nEnforcing Trade Agreements for a Level Playing FieldThis is why enforcing the trade rules we have continues to be a priority this year for the Administration.  We will continue to level the playing field for American workers and businesses.  We are vigorously enforcing our trade agreements, defending American jobs, and making sure more people enjoy the benefits of trade.For the USMCA, this extends to the interests and rights of our farmers and agricultural producers.I know the agricultural biotechnology concerns with Mexico are important to our farmers, especially our corn producers.  Last August, we established a dispute settlement panel under the USMCA.  We are working to resolve our concerns and help ensure that American farmers can continue to access the Mexican market and use innovative tools to respond to climate and food security challenges.I also know that many of you are concerned that Mexico is undermining American companies and U.S.-produced energy in favor of Mexico’s state-owned utility and oil and gas company.  We launched dispute settlement consultations under USMCA with Mexico to address those concerns and continue engagement with our stakeholders on developments.On Canada dairy, the United States won a USMCA dispute on Canada’s tariff rate quota allocation measures.  However, Canada’s revised policies did not fix the problem for U.S. dairy farmers, and we will continue to work with Canada to resolve our dairy industry’s concerns.We have also activated the tools for environmental enforcement under the USMCA by engaging in consultations with Mexico relating to the protection of the critically endangered vaquita porpoise, the prevention of illegal fishing, and trafficking of totoaba fish.I also want to note that, last year, the United States prevailed at the WTO in the cases against the retaliatory tariffs the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Türkiye illegally imposed in response to the U.S. Section 232 national security actions on steel and aluminum.These matters are a priority for USTR this year, and enforcement is one way we are fighting for American farmers, ranchers, producers, workers, and businesses.We are also working tirelessly with trading partners to open markets for hardworking American families and communities—especially our rural communities—to get more wins.nWins for U.S. Agriculture and Rural CommunitiesWe signed an agreement with the EU to modify tariff rate quota (TRQ) allocations on several important U.S. products, including rice, wheat, and corn.We revised the beef safeguard mechanism under the U.S. – Japan Trade agreement, to allow U.S. beef exporters to more reliably meet Japan’s growing demand for high-quality beef.  In 2023, U.S. beef and beef product exports to Japan were $1.8 billion, accounting for more than 46 percent of Japan’s total beef and beef product market.We are shipping more fresh potatoes to Mexico now, beyond the previous limit of a 26-kilometer zone along the U.S.-Mexico border.  U.S. fresh potato exports to Mexico, our largest export market, grew from $82.7 million in 2022 to $117.4 million in 2023.  This benefits U.S. potato growers from Idaho to Maine.We also got major wins for our poultry producers—South Africa lifted restrictions on U.S. poultry and poultry products, and we reopened the Colombian market for U.S. poultry and egg products.Specifically, let me highlight what we did to open the Indian market for our exports.Last June, India and the United States terminated six WTO disputes, and India agreed to remove retaliatory tariffs on several U.S. products.This means improved access for chickpeas, lentils, almonds, walnuts, and apples benefiting farmers across the country, including in Michigan, Oregon, and Washington.Additionally, in September, India and the United States resolved our final outstanding WTO dispute, and India agreed to reduce tariffs on several U.S. products.This means more market access for turkey, duck, blueberries, and cranberries benefiting farmers in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.We also worked with Japan to implement a new biofuels policy that will allow the United States to capture up to 100 percent of Japan’s on-road ethanol market.I know this is important to many of you.  Under this policy, exports of U.S. ethanol could increase by over 80 million gallons annually, representing an additional $150-200 million in exports each year.  This is an important win for our producers in Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota.U.S. agricultural exports totaled $174.9 billion in 2023, and our Administration has won over $21 billion worth of new agricultural market access in the last three years.However, this is more than just numbers.  It is about people, their livelihoods, and their communities.People like the first-generation farmer I met in Rowesville, South Carolina.  I met him last December together with Congressman Clyburn at his farm where he grows corn, soybeans, cotton, and small grains.Families growing almonds, like one my Chief Agricultural Negotiator, Doug McKalip, visited in the Central Valley of California last fall.This family was impacted by India’s retaliatory tariffs imposed in 2019, limiting their access to a vital market for their operation.  We removed those tariffs and provided more economic certainty for this family and many others.We are working hard in our efforts to not leave anyone behind.  We are making sure that Americans do not have to abandon their hometowns to find opportunity.nMaking Trade Work for All AmericansTrade should work for all Americans.  This is why we are taking unprecedented steps to incorporate more voices into trade policymaking.Just as you stay connected with the constituents in your districts, I have travelled around the country to hear from workers, farmers, and small businesses, and Tribal leaders to learn how trade affects them.I have also made it a priority to meet with a wide range of stakeholders to ensure their views inform our work, including civil society and labor leaders.I know this approach may be surprising to some, but this should and must be the norm moving forward—because my job is to represent the entirety of the United States, not just those who can afford Washington lobbyists.We need to deliver more equitable, fairer outcomes for more Americans.  If we want different results, we need different inputs—from more people across our society.This consultation includes Congress and this Committee.Like our stakeholders, there is a wide range of views in Congress on trade.  Over the last few years, I have welcomed all of your views, and I truly value the various perspectives I hear from Congress.  Moving forward, I will continue partnering with you as we carry out our agenda.Pursuing the interests of all Americans is a clear mandate and vision in the President’s Trade Policy Agenda, and we are placing utmost importance on this work this year.We also know that we need more and better data to informing our work.  This is why USTR is continuing to work with the U.S. International Trade Commission, and we requested that the USITC repeat the distributional effects investigation every three years for the next 15 years.This is critical for policymakers, researchers, and the public to monitor and ensure progress in assessing the distributional effects of trade policy on U.S. workers.  Better input, for better output.We are also institutionalizing the principles of fairness and equity in our negotiations and regional engagements.For the first time, we have partnered on inclusivity chapters in our trade negotiations, including those with Kenya.  We are also meeting with a broad base of stakeholders to gather input, such as the African Diaspora, and women, youth, civil rights organizations.During our Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) host year, I was proud to host first-ever minister-level dialogues with Labor and Indigenous leaders.We also announced during APEC that the United States is exploring observership in the Indigenous Peoples Economic and Trade Cooperation Arrangement, or the IPETCA.This is a direct result of our annual Tribal consultations and engagements with Indigenous leaders and communities, and this will be a cornerstone of our work going forward in APEC and in other fora.This includes the World Trade Organization (WTO), where, during the Thirteenth Ministerial Conference (MC13) in February, U.S. leadership was reflected in the effort of ministers holding a first-ever discussion specifically on how the WTO can help foster better outcomes for more people.nTransforming the WTOThis is part of our overall effort to make the WTO more responsive and effective.Our Administration is working with other WTO Members on a reform agenda that reflects priorities of our worker-centered approach—improving labor standards, protecting our planet, and advancing shared prosperity.MC13 was an important milestone to gauge our progress to date, and we announced several important outcomes.We made more progress on dispute settlement reform in the last year than we did in the last several decades.We extended the e-commerce moratorium, which was not a forgone conclusion.We also announced significant development outcomes.We ensured that Members graduating from the least developed countries (LDC) category can continue a smooth transition.  We agreed to support their capacity to effectively utilize the Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, and we supported a work program for small and vulnerable economies.We also agreed to hold dedicated sessions on issues important to land-locked developing countries.Our discussions in Abu Dhabi highlighted that developing economies, both large and small, are having important debates over what rules and policies best serve their interests.  This includes issues such as inclusivity, sustainable development, and the need for our trade policies to be flexible to allow WTO Members to manage current global challenges.While MC13 is over, our work at the WTO continues, and our Administration remains committed to working with all WTO Members to develop a common agenda that allows all of us to have our priorities reflected.nCollaborating with Trading PartnersWhat we are trying to do in Geneva is reshaping the global trading system for the better, for the future, for the people.  And those are the goals of our regional and bilateral trade initiatives as well.We are making significant progress with Taiwan.Last June, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) signed the first agreement under the United States – Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade.  This was less than a year after we announced the negotiating mandate in August 2022.The first agreement focuses on economically meaningful areas to build our middle classes together.For example, small business owners tell me that tariffs are not the primary reason they cannot export more of their products—in many cases, it is because of the red tape.So, the first agreement with Taiwan includes commitments on simplifying customs procedures and making rulemaking processes more transparent, among other issues.  It also includes specific provisions to help SMEs compete and thrive, including addressing corruption.Furthering these negotiations with Taiwan is a high priority for USTR this year.We are making progress on the U.S. – Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) as well.  Our teams recently wrapped up a third negotiating round.The United States has tabled text on agriculture, anticorruption, SMEs, and services domestic regulation.Together, we are working closely to deliver real benefits to our people and so that the STIP can serve as a model for engagement with other willing countries on the African continent—all while respecting the priority of integration among African countries themselves.An important part of these negotiations is to make sure that any trade deal incentivizes a race to the top, for our people and for our planet.  This is why we have tabled strong text on labor rights and the environment in these discussions, and also in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).Trade deals take time, but our team made more progress in the last year than what would typically take years to complete.I am incredibly proud of my team for what we have accomplished.  We are continuing forward with a new and innovative approach to trade, designed to create durable and sustainable economic growth.This also applies to our work with African growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) partners and in our planning for the next AGOA Forum later this year.I met incredible workers, small business owners, and entrepreneurs when I was in Johannesburg for the AGOA Forum last November.  AGOA has helped Africa grow its extraordinary economic potential over the last two decades.Its renewal is important to continue to bring real change to people across the continent, and our Administration fully supports renewal beyond 2025.  However, we must also seize this opportunity to make AGOA better, to improve utilization rates, and to explore other trade tools to complement our AGOA relationship.nPromoting Supply Chain Resilience Through TradeIncreasingly, we are seeing that a sense of growing economic insecurity is shared by different communities across continents, and people everywhere felt this more acutely during the pandemic.Lives and livelihoods, homes and communities were disrupted.  This is why reducing dependencies and vulnerabilities and strengthening supply chains is a major priority for USTR this year, which informs our work as part of the President’s Council on Supply Chain Resilience.Resilient supply chains also reduce opportunities for economic coercion and enhance our economic security.  They provide a range of sourcing options; adapt, rebound, and recover with agility following shocks; uphold labor rights and environmental protections; and strengthen the U.S. manufacturing base and workforce.We have been focused on this topic in various fora, including the G7, G20, APEC, and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  This also includes our work through the Trade Track under the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, where a lot of our efforts will focus on supply chain resilience.But to continue our work to develop innovative trade tools and strategies for connecting trade and other economic policy measures to advance supply chain resilience, we published a Federal Register notice last month.This will allow USTR to draw upon various perspectives and experiences to get a more granular understanding of the challenges and to identify potential policy solutions.We are integrating trade tools with domestic economic measures to position U.S. manufacturing and services for continued leadership and competitiveness.  We are also collaborating with trading partners and allies to incentivize a race to the top through stronger coordination and alignment on labor and environmental protections within trusted networks.I was in Burlington, North Carolina a few weeks ago, and met with the owners and workers of Glen Raven, a family-owned fabrics and textiles company.  I heard first-hand how important it is for us to pursue resilience over efficiency, for our workers and businesses.I also visited the Marsh Furniture Company, a family-owned cabinet manufacturer in High Point, North Carolina.  We talked about the company’s rich, 100-year history, and why it is critical to address unfair practices by the PRC and other economies.nStanding up to the PRC’s Unfair Economic Practices and Fighting for Fair CompetitionAt its core, this is about giving everyone a fair shot.However, that is not possible when countries like the PRC continue to use non-market policies and practices to dominate industries. That dominance is what enables the PRC to coerce other economies.The PRC’s unfair policies and practices have devastated many working communities and industries across our country, including many in your districts.Steel, aluminum, solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, and critical minerals—just to name a few.The PRC also uses unfair policies and practices to concentrate production of certain goods in the PRC, which undermines supply chain resilience and harms consumers that, in the long run, are deprived of the innovation and choice that fair competition would produce.As the President said during his State of the Union Address, this Administration will continue to stand up to China’s unfair, non-market policies and practices.  And we are doing so with like-minded partners and allies, as you saw in the Joint Declaration we issued last June with Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.We have seen the PRC create dependencies and vulnerabilities in multiple sectors, harming American workers and businesses and creating real risks for our supply chains.This is why we are taking a serious look at how our existing tools are addressing this problem, including through our four-year review of the China Section 301 tariffs.This is also why I am closely reviewing the Section 301 petition I received from the five national labor unions regarding the PRC’s acts, policies, and practices in the critical maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sector.Our economic relationship with the PRC is complex, and as the President said, we want competition with China, not conflict.But the competition must be fair, and USTR and the Biden-Harris Administration are fighting every day to put working families first, rebuild American manufacturing, and strengthen our supply chains.We’re using trade to give everyone a fair shot.  That means creating incentives that are more than lower costs; raising labor and environmental standards; and pursuing resiliency.USTR will remain focused this year on developing innovative trade tools and strategies for connecting trade and other economic policy measures to advance these goals.  I want to thank my USTR team, serving in Washington, DC, and around the world, for their unwavering devotion and determination to serve all of America.I think we all agree that our economic system, including trade, should strengthen the middle class.  I look forward to continuing our partnership through regular briefings with you and your staff, as we have done for the last three years.Thank you.nn###",

pay.Shortly after the case was closed, the independent union negotiated additional benefits for workers, including a nine percent wage increase and a 6.8 percent increase in the overall value of non-wage benefits, as well as an increase in vacation days, bonuses, compliance with required overtime pay, and improvements to working conditions to address work-related injuries.This is real positive change for these workers in Mexico, but also helps ensure that the good-paying jobs our Administration is creating stays here, in our communities.This is how we are building up our working communities and middle classes together, giving them a fair shot to thrive in this global economy.nEnforcing Trade Agreements for a Level Playing FieldThis is why enforcing the trade rules we have continues to be a priority this year for the Administration.  We will continue to level the playing field for American workers and businesses.  We are vigorously enforcing our trade agreements, defending American jobs, and making sure more people enjoy the benefits of trade.For the USMCA, this extends to the interests and rights of our farmers and agricultural producers.I know the agricultural biotechnology concerns with Mexico are important to our farmers, especially our corn producers.  Last August, we established a dispute settlement panel under the USMCA.  We are working to resolve our concerns and help ensure that American farmers can continue to access the Mexican market and use innovative tools to respond to climate and food security challenges.I also know that many of you are concerned that Mexico is undermining American companies and U.S.-produced energy in favor of Mexico’s state-owned utility and oil and gas company.  We launched dispute settlement consultations under USMCA with Mexico to address those concerns and continue engagement with our stakeholders on developments.On Canada dairy, the United States won a USMCA dispute on Canada’s tariff rate quota allocation measures.  However, Canada’s revised policies did not fix the problem for U.S. dairy farmers, and we will continue to work with Canada to resolve our dairy industry’s concerns.We have also activated the tools for environmental enforcement under the USMCA by engaging in consultations with Mexico relating to the protection of the critically endangered vaquita porpoise, the prevention of illegal fishing, and trafficking of totoaba fish.I also want to note that, last year, the United States prevailed at the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the cases against the retaliatory tariffs the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Türkiye illegally imposed in response to the U.S. Section 232 national security actions on steel and aluminum.These matters are a priority for USTR this year, and enforcement is one way we are fighting for American farmers, ranchers, producers, workers, and businesses.We are also working tirelessly with trading partners to open markets for hardworking American families and communities—especially our rural communities—to get more wins.nWins for U.S. Agriculture and Rural CommunitiesWe signed an agreement with the EU to modify tariff rate quota (TRQ) allocations on several important U.S. products, including rice, wheat, and corn.We revised the beef safeguard mechanism under the U.S. – Japan Trade agreement, to allow U.S. beef exporters to more reliably meet Japan’s growing demand for high-quality beef.  In 2023, U.S. beef and beef product exports to Japan were $1.8 billion, accounting for more than 46 percent of Japan’s total beef and beef product market.We are shipping more fresh potatoes to Mexico now, beyond the previous limit of a 26-kilometer zone along the U.S.-Mexico border.  U.S. fresh potato exports to Mexico, our largest export market, grew from $82.7 million in 2022 to $117.4 million in 2023. This benefits U.S. potato growers from Idaho to Maine.We also got major wins for our poultry producers—South Africa lifted restrictions on U.S. poultry and poultry products, and we reopened the Colombian market for U.S. poultry and egg products.Specifically, let me highlight what we did to open the Indian market for our exports.Last June, India and the United States terminated six WTO disputes, and India agreed to remove retaliatory tariffs on several U.S. products.This means improved access for chickpeas, lentils, almonds, walnuts, and apples benefiting farmers across the country, including in Michigan, Oregon, and Washington.Additionally, in September, India and the United States resolved our final outstanding WTO dispute, and India agreed to reduce tariffs on several U.S. products.This means more market access for turkey, duck, blueberries, and cranberries benefiting farmers in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Wisconsin.We also worked with Japan to implement a new biofuels policy that will allow the United States to capture up to 100 percent of Japan’s on-road ethanol market.I know this is important to many of you.  Under this policy, exports of U.S. ethanol could increase by over 80 million gallons annually, representing an additional $150-200 million in exports each year.  This is an important win for our producers in Iowa, Missouri, and South Dakota.U.S. agricultural exports totaled $174.9 billion in 2023, and our Administration has won over $21 billion worth of new agricultural market access in the last three years.However, this is more than just numbers.  It is about people, their livelihoods, and their communities.People like the first-generation farmer I met in Rowesville, South Carolina.  I met him last December together with Congressman Clyburn at his farm where he grows corn, soybeans, cotton, and small grains.Families growing almonds, like one my Chief Agricultural Negotiator, Doug McKalip, visited in the Central Valley of California last fall.This family was impacted by India’s retaliatory tariffs imposed in 2019, limiting their access to a vital market for their operation.  We removed those tariffs and provided more economic certainty for this family and many others.We are working hard in our efforts to not leave anyone behind.  We are making sure that Americans do not have to abandon their hometowns to find opportunity.nMaking Trade Work for All AmericansTrade should work for all Americans.  This is why we are taking unprecedented steps to incorporate more voices into trade policymaking.Just as you stay connected with the constituents in your states, I have travelled around the country to hear from workers, farmers, and small businesses, and Tribal leaders to learn how trade affects them.I have also made it a priority to meet with a wide range of stakeholders to ensure their views inform our work, including civil society and labor leaders.I know this approach may be surprising to some, but this should and must be the norm moving forward—because my job is to represent the entirety of the United States, not just those who can afford Washington lobbyists.We need to deliver more equitable, fairer outcomes for more Americans.  If we want different results, we need different inputs—from more people across our society.This consultation includes Congress and this Committee.Like our stakeholders, there is a wide range of views in Congress on trade.  Over the last few years, I have welcomed all of your views, and I truly value the various perspectives I hear from Congress.  Moving forward, I will continue partnering with you as we carry out our agenda.Pursuing the interests of all Americans is a clear mandate and vision in the President’s Trade Policy Agenda, and we are placing utmost importance on this work this year.We also know that we need more and better data to informing our work.  This is why USTR is continuing to work with the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC), and we requested that the USITC repeat the distributional effects investigation every three years for the next 15 years.This is critical for policymakers, researchers, and the public to monitor and ensure progress in assessing the distributional effects of trade policy on U.S. workers.  Better input, for better output.We are also institutionalizing the principles of fairness and equity in our negotiations and regional engagements.For the first time, we have partnered on inclusivity chapters in our trade negotiations, including those with Kenya.  We are also meeting with a broad base of stakeholders to gather input, such as the African Diaspora, and women, youth, and civil rights organizations.During our Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) host year, I was proud to host first-ever minister-level dialogues with Labor and Indigenous leaders.We also announced during APEC that the United States is exploring observership in the Indigenous Peoples Economic and Trade Cooperation Arrangement, or the IPETCA.This is a direct result of our annual Tribal consultations and engagements with Indigenous leaders and communities, and this will be a cornerstone of our work going forward in APEC and in other fora.This includes the WTO, where, during the Thirteenth Ministerial Conference (MC13) in February, U.S. leadership was reflected in the effort of ministers holding a first-ever discussion specifically on how the WTO can help foster better outcomes for more people.nTransforming the WTOThis is part of our overall effort to make the WTO more responsive and effective.Our Administration is working with other WTO Members on a reform agenda that reflects priorities of our worker-centered approach—improving labor standards, protecting our planet, and advancing shared prosperity.MC13 was an important milestone to gauge our progress to date, and we announced several important outcomes.We made more progress on dispute settlement reform in the last year than we did in the last several decades.We extended the e-commerce moratorium, which was not a forgone conclusion.We also announced significant development outcomes.We ensured that Members graduating from the least developed countries (LDC) category can continue a smooth transition.  We agreed to support their capacity to effectively utilize the Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, and we supported a work program for small and vulnerable economies.We also agreed to hold dedicated sessions on issues important to land-locked developing countries.Our discussions in Abu Dhabi highlighted that developing economies, both large and small, are having important debates over what rules and policies best serve their interests.  This includes issues such as inclusivity, sustainable development, and the need for our trade policies to be flexible to allow WTO Members to manage current global challenges.While MC13 is over, our work at the WTO continues, and our Administration remains committed to working with all WTO Members to develop a common agenda that allows all of us to have our priorities reflected.nCollaborating with Trading PartnersWhat we are trying to do in Geneva is reshaping the global trading system for the better, for the future, for the people.  And those are the goals of our regional and bilateral trade initiatives as well.We are making significant progress with Taiwan.Last June, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) signed the first agreement under the United States – Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade.  This was less than a year after we announced the negotiating mandate in August 2022.The first agreement focuses on economically meaningful areas to build our middle classes together.For example, small business owners tell me that tariffs are not the primary reason they cannot export more of their products—in many cases, it is because of the red tape.So, the first agreement with Taiwan includes commitments on simplifying customs procedures and making rulemaking processes more transparent, among other issues.  It also includes specific provisions to help SMEs compete and thrive, including addressing corruption.Furthering these negotiations with Taiwan is a high priority for USTR this year.We are making progress on the U.S. – Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) as well.  Our teams recently wrapped up a third negotiating round.The United States has tabled text on agriculture, anticorruption, SMEs, and services domestic regulation.Together, we are working closely to deliver real benefits to our people and so that the STIP can serve as a model for engagement with other willing countries on the African continent—all while respecting the priority of integration among African countries themselves.An important part of these negotiations is to make sure that any trade deal incentivizes a race to the top, for our people and for our planet.  This is why we have tabled strong text on labor rights and the environment in these discussions, and also in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).Trade deals take time, but our team made more progress in the last year than what would typically take years to complete.I am incredibly proud of my team for what we have accomplished.  We are continuing forward with a new and innovative approach to trade, designed to create durable and sustainable economic growth.This also applies to our work with African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) partners and in our planning for the next AGOA Forum later this year.I met incredible workers, small business owners, and entrepreneurs when I was in Johannesburg for the AGOA Forum last November.  AGOA has helped Africa grow its extraordinary economic potential over the last two decades.Its renewal is important to continue to bring real change to people across the continent, and our Administration fully supports renewal beyond 2025.  However, we must also seize this opportunity to make AGOA better, to improve utilization rates, and to explore other trade tools to complement our AGOA relationship.nPromoting Supply Chain Resilience Through TradeIncreasingly, we are seeing that a sense of growing economic insecurity is shared by different communities across continents, and people everywhere felt this more acutely during the pandemic.Lives and livelihoods, homes and communities were disrupted.  This is why reducing dependencies and vulnerabilities and strengthening supply chains is a major priority for USTR this year, which informs our work as part of the President’s Council on Supply Chain Resilience.Resilient supply chains also reduce opportunities for economic coercion and enhance our economic security.  They provide a range of sourcing options; adapt, rebound, and recover with agility following shocks; uphold labor rights and environmental protections; and strengthen the U.S. manufacturing base and workforce.We have been focused on this topic in various fora, including the G7, G20, APEC, and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  This also includes our work through the Trade Track under the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, where a lot of our efforts will focus on supply chain resilience.But to continue our work to develop innovative trade tools and strategies for connecting trade and other economic policy measures to advance supply chain resilience, we published a Federal Register notice last month.This will allow USTR to draw upon various perspectives and experiences to get a more granular understanding of the challenges and to identify potential policy solutions.We are integrating trade tools with domestic economic measures to position U.S. manufacturing and services for continued leadership and competitiveness.  We are also collaborating with trading partners and allies to incentivize a race to the top through stronger coordination and alignment on labor and environmental protections within trusted networks.I was in Burlington, North Carolina a few weeks ago, and met with the owners and workers of Glen Raven, a family-owned fabrics and textiles company.  I heard first-hand how important it is for us to pursue resilience over efficiency, for our workers and businesses.I also visited the Marsh Furniture Company, a family-owned cabinet manufacturer in High Point, North Carolina.  We talked about the company’s rich, 100-year history, and why it is critical to address unfair practices by the PRC and other economies.nStanding up to the PRC’s Unfair Economic Practices and Fighting for Fair CompetitionAt its core, this is about giving everyone a fair shot.However, that is not possible when countries like the PRC continue to use non-market policies and practices to dominate industries. That dominance is what enables the PRC to coerce other economies.The PRC’s unfair policies and practices have devastated many working communities and industries across our country, including many in your states.Steel, aluminum, solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, and critical minerals—just to name a few.The PRC also uses unfair policies and practices to concentrate production of certain goods in the PRC, which undermines supply chain resilience and harms consumers that, in the long run, are deprived of the innovation and choice that fair competition would produce.As the President said during his State of the Union Address, this Administration will continue to stand up to China’s unfair, non-market policies and practices.  And we are doing so with like-minded partners and allies, as you saw in the Joint Declaration we issued last June with Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.We have seen the PRC create dependencies and vulnerabilities in multiple sectors, harming American workers and businesses and creating real risks for our supply chains.This is why we are taking a serious look at how our existing tools are addressing this problem, including through our four-year review of the China Section 301 tariffs.This is also why, after close review of the Section 301 petition I received from five national labor unions, I have initiated a full and thorough investigation of the PRC’s longstanding efforts to dominate the maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sectors. The unions’ petition raises serious concerns about harms to U.S. workers, the shipbuilding industry, and U.S. resilience.Our economic relationship with the PRC is complex, and as the President said, we want competition with China, not conflict.But the competition must be fair, and USTR and the Biden-Harris Administration are fighting every day to put working families first, rebuild American manufacturing, and strengthen our supply chains.We’re using trade to give everyone a fair shot.  That means creating incentives that are more than lower costs; raising labor and environmental standards; and pursuing resiliency.USTR will remain focused this year on developing innovative trade tools and strategies for connecting trade and other economic policy measures to advance these goals.  I want to thank my USTR team, serving in Washington, DC, and around the world, for their unwavering devotion and determination to serve all of America.I think we all agree that our economic system, including trade, should strengthen the middle class.  I look forward to continuing our partnership through regular briefings with you and your staff, as we have done for the last three years.Thank you.n###",

Special Envoy to Northern Ireland for Economic Affairs, Joe Kennedy III, provided closing remarks at the SME Dialogue.Participants at the SME Dialogue discussed opportunities and obstacles to SME trade, including resources available to support their growth in trade between our countries. The discussions focused on the creative industries, digitalization and paperless trading, and intellectual property protection. At the SME Dialogue the U.S. and UK also jointly highlighted their intellectual property (IP) toolkits to help support small businesses.nEstablished in 2018 in Washington, D.C. and London, and convening subsequently in New York, Bristol, Boston, Edinburgh, and Indio, the SME Dialogue is an ongoing exchange bringing small and medium businesses and stakeholders on both sides of the Atlantic together with government officials to identify ways to deepen U.S.-UK trade and investment ties and strengthen cooperation on issues of mutual interest to SMEs. Trade between the two countries is about $296 billion per year, and together there is around $1.7 trillion invested in each other’s economies. Ninety-two percent of U.S. exporters to the UK are small and medium-sized firms, with over 36,000 small businesses across the 50 states exporting $28.2 billion in goods to the United Kingdom.nn###",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – Today at 10:00 AM ET, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai will testify before the House Committee on Ways and Means on President Biden’s 2024Trade Policy Agenda. Ambassador Tai will highlight how the Biden-Harris Administration’s trade agenda is supporting economic growth from the middle out and the bottom up by empowering workers both at home and abroad, rebuilding American manufacturing, and strengthening the resilience of U.S. supply chains.nThe live webcast will be accessible on the House Ways & Means Committeewebsite.The full text of Ambassador Tai's written testimony is below:nnChairman Smith, Ranking Member Neal, and Members of the Committee.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the President’s Trade Policy Agenda.  Congress is our constitutional partner on trade, and I am delighted to be here to discuss our agenda and hear your views.President Biden summed it up during his State of the Union Address last month—America is writing the greatest comeback story never told.Our Administration’s economic plan is leading our country in the strongest economic recovery amongst all developed nations.  More importantly, we are doing so in a way that democratizes economic opportunity for more people.We have shifted the conversation from focusing on the bigs to including and championing the interests of the smalls and the mediums.  From trickle down to bottom up.  From people as consumers only to people as workers also.We are reorienting the economic system to strengthen the middle class.The President’s trade agenda is critical to this reorientation.  In the past, trade policy primarily focused on and benefitted the largest stakeholders, but we are flipping that top-down approach on its head.Trade is a tool to give all Americans a fair shot and ensure that our system is set up for inclusive and durable growth. Promoting healthy competition is critical to achieving this goal. This is why I am honored to serve as a member of the White House Competition Council, to align our trade agenda with our domestic economic tools to advance fair competition for more people.It is also a critical tool for building robust supply chains that lower costs for American families, a goal I work to advance as a member of the President’s Council on Supply Chain Resilience.Asking old tools to solve new challenges—like economic insecurity, fragile supply chains, and a worsening climate crisis—is destined to fail.  We must question assumptions, revisit norms, and think creatively and strategically.In this new era, we increasingly measure success and progress by the degree to which we are delivering real benefits to more Americans across our society—no matter where you live or whether you have a college degree.Our approach is one that addresses and advances the interests of all parts of our economy and does not pit Americans against Americans.  Let me give you some examples of what middle-out, bottom-up trade policy looks like.nEmpowering Workers Through TradeFirst, we are using trade to empower workers, because they are the backbone of our economy.  Their success is our success.We are incentivizing a race to the top so that we are not pitting our workers against those in other countries and regions.  Fellow trade ministers tell me that they too want to build their economies from the middle out, and enacting and maintaining high labor standards is key.This is why the United States has prioritized strong labor commitments in our ongoing trade initiatives, including in our negotiations with Kenya and Taiwan.As part of this process, USTR has consulted extensively with labor stakeholders, in addition to the business community.  We will continue to work with our trading partners and with you to ensure that our trade agreements work for workers.This is also why we are using innovative tools with our trading partners to address harmful practices, such as forced labor.  Our work with Japan through the Task Force on the Promotion of Human Rights and International Labor Standards in Supply Chains is one example.This is a part of our Administration’s broader strategy to fight for workers’ rights around the world, including through the first-ever Presidential Memorandum outlining our commitment to worker rights globally, signed by President Biden last November.Advancing workers’ rights abroad also strengthens workers here at home.  This is possible when we are not pitting our working communities against each other, but instead allowing them to compete fairly and thrive in this global economy.  This is what it looks like to align our domestic and foreign economic priorities—a foreign policy for the middle class.At a press conference in San Francisco on the launch of the Memorandum, I had the privilege to meet Rudy Gonzalez, Secretary-Treasurer of the San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council.  He spoke with such passion and conviction on why our approach is important to real, working people.It is because of friends like Rudy and his colleagues that we are also focused on enforcing the labor provisions in agreements we already have.  Trade agreements are not trophies to admire on shelves—they are tools to get us results.  The United States – Mexico – Canada Agreement is a prime example.When I worked for the Ways & Means Committee, I worked with many of you to create the USMCA’s Rapid Response Labor Mechanism, and I want to share what it is doing for working people.Since 2021, the United States has sought Mexico’s review under the RRM 22 times at facilities that span various industries, including automotive, garments, mining, and services.These cases have so far directly benefited 30,000 workers, provided five million dollars in backpay and benefits to workers, ensured wrongly terminated workers were reinstated, and helped secure free and fair elections in which workers selected independent unions to represent them.Last July, I participated in a labor stakeholder forum on the margins of a USMCA free Trade Commission (FTC) meeting in Mexico.  There, I met Juan Gerardo Castor Puentes, a special delegate for the Mexican Workers’ League.It is a union that represents garment workers at a factory near the Coahuila-Texas border.  He shared with me how important it was for governments to work together to fight for workers and their interests—how doing so is making a real positive impact on people’s daily lives.This not only affects workers in Mexico, it also empowers U.S. workers by reducing the incentive to unfairly ship jobs overseas.There are many success stories to choose from, but I want to highlight the Teksid facility in Frontera, Mexico.In that case, the United States requested Mexico’s review of whether workers at the facility were being threatened or coerced into choosing a particular union, and whether workers were being subject to a state-level collective bargaining agreement that was inferior to a federal-level collective bargaining agreement.  The company was also refusing to recognize the independent union that held the right to represent workers at the facility.As a result of the RRM, 36 workers who had been wrongfully terminated were reinstated and given backpay.  The independent union was given access to the facility and even paid dues that were previously withheld from workers’ pay.Shortly after the case was closed, the independent union negotiated additional benefits for workers, including a nine percent wage increase and a 6.8 percent increase in the overall value of non-wage benefits, as well as an increase in vacation days, bonuses, compliance with required overtime pay, and improvements to working conditions to address work-related injuries.This is real positive change for these workers in Mexico, but also helps ensure that the good-paying jobs our Administration is creating stays here, in our communities.This is how we are building up our working communities and middle classes together, giving them a fair shot to thrive in this global economy.nEnforcing Trade Agreements for a Level Playing FieldThis is why enforcing the trade rules we have continues to be a priority this year for the Administration.  We will continue to level the playing field for American workers and businesses.  We are vigorously enforcing our trade agreements, defending American jobs, and making sure more people enjoy the benefits of trade.For the USMCA, this extends to the interests and rights of our farmers and agricultural

USMCA.  We are working to resolve our concerns and help ensure that American farmers can continue to access the Mexican market and use innovative tools to respond to climate and food security challenges.I also know that many of you are concerned that Mexico is undermining American companies and U.S.-produced energy in favor of Mexico’s state-owned utility and oil and gas company.  We launched dispute settlement consultations under USMCA with Mexico to address those concerns and continue engagement with our stakeholders on developments.On Canada dairy, the United States won a USMCA dispute on Canada’s tariff rate quota allocation measures.  However, Canada’s revised policies did not fix the problem for U.S. dairy farmers, and we will continue to work with Canada to resolve our dairy industry’s concerns.We have also activated the tools for environmental enforcement under the USMCA by engaging in consultations with Mexico relating to the protection of the critically endangered vaquita porpoise, the prevention of illegal fishing, and trafficking of totoaba fish.I also want to note that, last year, the United States prevailed at the WTO in the cases against the retaliatory tariffs the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and Türkiye illegally imposed in response to the U.S. Section 232 national security actions on steel and aluminum.These matters are a priority for USTR this year, and enforcement is one way we are fighting for American farmers, ranchers, producers, workers, and businesses.We are also working tirelessly with trading partners to open markets for hardworking American families and communities—especially our rural communities—to get more wins.nWins for U.S. Agriculture and Rural CommunitiesWe signed an agreement with the EU to modify tariff rate quota (TRQ) allocations on several important U.S. products, including rice, wheat, and corn.We revised the beef safeguard mechanism under the U.S. – Japan Trade agreement, to allow U.S. beef

civil rights organizations.During our Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) host year, I was proud to host first-ever minister-level dialogues with Labor and Indigenous leaders.We also announced during APEC that the United States is exploring observership in the Indigenous Peoples Economic and Trade Cooperation Arrangement, or the IPETCA.This is a direct result of our annual Tribal consultations and engagements with Indigenous leaders and communities, and this will be a cornerstone of our work going forward in APEC and in other fora.This includes the World Trade Organization (WTO), where, during the Thirteenth Ministerial Conference (MC13) in February, U.S. leadership was reflected in the effort of ministers holding a first-ever discussion specifically on how the WTO can help foster better outcomes for more people.nTransforming the WTOThis is part of our overall effort to make the WTO more responsive and effective.Our Administration is working with other WTO Members on a reform agenda that reflects priorities of our worker-centered approach—improving labor standards, protecting our planet, and advancing shared prosperity.MC13 was an important milestone to gauge our progress to date, and we announced several important outcomes.We made more progress on dispute settlement reform in the last year than we did in the last several decades.We extended the e-commerce moratorium, which was not a forgone conclusion.We also announced significant development outcomes.We ensured that Members graduating from the least developed countries (LDC) category can continue a smooth transition.  We agreed to support their capacity to effectively utilize the Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, and we supported a work program for small and vulnerable economies.We also agreed to hold dedicated sessions on issues important to land-locked developing countries.Our discussions in Abu Dhabi highlighted that developing economies, both large and small, are having important debates over what rules and policies best serve their interests.  This includes issues such as inclusivity, sustainable development, and the need for our trade policies to be flexible to allow WTO Members to manage current global challenges.While MC13 is over, our work at the WTO continues, and our Administration remains committed to working with all WTO Members to develop a common agenda that allows all of us to have our priorities reflected.nCollaborating with Trading PartnersWhat we are trying to do in Geneva is reshaping the global trading system for the better, for the future, for the people.  And those are the goals of our regional and bilateral trade initiatives as well.We are making significant progress with Taiwan.Last June, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the United States (TECRO) signed the first agreement under the United States – Taiwan Initiative on 21st-Century Trade.  This was less than a year after we announced the negotiating mandate in August 2022.The first agreement focuses on economically meaningful areas to build our middle classes together.For example, small business owners tell me that tariffs are not the primary reason they cannot export more of their products—in many cases, it is because of the red tape.So, the first agreement with Taiwan includes commitments on simplifying customs procedures and making rulemaking processes more transparent, among other issues.  It also includes specific provisions to help SMEs compete and thrive, including addressing corruption.Furthering these negotiations with Taiwan is a high priority for USTR this year.We are making progress on the U.S. – Kenya Strategic Trade and Investment Partnership (STIP) as well.  Our teams recently wrapped up a third negotiating round.The United States has tabled text on agriculture, anticorruption, SMEs, and services domestic regulation.Together, we are working closely to deliver real benefits to our people and so that the STIP can serve as a model for engagement with other willing countries on the African continent—all while respecting the priority of integration among African countries themselves.An important part of these negotiations is to make sure that any trade deal incentivizes a race to the top, for our people and for our planet.  This is why we have tabled strong text on labor rights and the environment in these discussions, and also in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF).Trade deals take time, but our team made more progress in the last year than what would typically take years to complete.I am incredibly proud of my team for what we have accomplished.  We are continuing forward with a new and innovative approach to trade, designed to create durable and sustainable economic growth.This also applies to our work with African growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) partners and in our planning for the next AGOA Forum later this year.I met incredible workers, small business owners, and entrepreneurs when I was in Johannesburg for the AGOA Forum last November.  AGOA has helped Africa grow its extraordinary economic potential over the last two decades.Its renewal is important to continue to bring real change to people across the continent, and our Administration fully supports renewal beyond 2025.  However, we must also seize this opportunity to make AGOA better, to improve utilization rates, and to explore other trade tools to complement our AGOA relationship.nPromoting Supply Chain Resilience Through TradeIncreasingly, we are seeing that a sense of growing economic insecurity is shared by different communities across continents, and people everywhere felt this more acutely during the pandemic.Lives and livelihoods, homes and communities were disrupted.  This is why reducing dependencies and vulnerabilities and strengthening supply chains is a major priority for USTR this year, which informs our work as part of the President’s Council on Supply Chain Resilience.Resilient supply chains also reduce opportunities for economic coercion and enhance our economic security.  They provide a range of sourcing options; adapt, rebound, and recover with agility following shocks; uphold labor rights and environmental protections; and strengthen the U.S. manufacturing base and workforce.We have been focused on this topic in various fora, including the G7, G20, APEC, and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  This also includes our work through the Trade Track under the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity, where a lot of our efforts will focus on supply chain resilience.But to continue our work to develop innovative trade tools and strategies for connecting trade and other economic policy measures to advance supply chain resilience, we published a Federal Register notice last month.This will allow USTR to draw upon various perspectives and experiences to get a more granular understanding of the challenges and to identify potential policy solutions.We are integrating trade tools with domestic economic measures to position U.S. manufacturing and services for continued leadership and competitiveness.  We are also collaborating with trading partners and allies to incentivize a race to the top through stronger coordination and alignment on labor and environmental protections within trusted networks.I was in Burlington, North Carolina a few weeks ago, and met with the owners and workers of Glen Raven, a family-owned fabrics and textiles company.  I heard first-hand how important it is for us to pursue resilience over efficiency, for our workers and businesses.I also visited the Marsh Furniture Company, a family-owned cabinet manufacturer in High Point, North Carolina.  We talked about the company’s rich, 100-year history, and why it is critical to address unfair practices by the PRC and other economies.nStanding up to the PRC’s Unfair Economic Practices and Fighting for Fair CompetitionAt its core, this is about giving everyone a fair shot.However, that is not possible when countries like the PRC continue to use non-market policies and practices to dominate industries. That dominance is what enables the PRC to coerce other economies.The PRC’s unfair policies and practices have devastated many working communities and industries across our country, including many in your districts.Steel, aluminum, solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, and critical minerals—just to name a few.The PRC also uses unfair policies and practices to concentrate production of certain goods in the PRC, which undermines supply chain resilience and harms consumers that, in the long run, are deprived of the innovation and choice that fair competition would produce.As the President said during his State of the Union Address, this Administration will continue to stand up to China’s unfair, non-market policies and practices.  And we are doing so with like-minded partners and allies, as you saw in the Joint Declaration we issued last June with Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.We have seen the PRC create dependencies and vulnerabilities in multiple sectors, harming American workers and businesses and creating real risks for our supply chains.This is why we are taking a serious look at how our existing tools are addressing this problem, including through our four-year review of the China Section 301 tariffs.This is also why I am closely reviewing the Section 301 petition I received from the five national labor unions regarding the PRC’s acts, policies, and practices in the critical maritime, logistics, and shipbuilding sector.Our economic relationship with the PRC is complex, and as the President said, we want competition with China, not conflict.But the competition must be fair, and USTR and the Biden-Harris Administration are fighting every day to put working families first, rebuild American manufacturing, and strengthen our supply chains.We’re using trade to give everyone a fair shot.  That means creating incentives that are more than lower costs; raising labor and environmental standards; and pursuing resiliency.USTR will remain focused this year on developing innovative trade tools and strategies for connecting trade and other economic policy measures to advance these goals.  I want to thank my USTR team, serving in Washington, DC, and around the world, for their unwavering devotion and determination to serve all of America.I think we all agree that our economic system, including trade, should strengthen the middle class.  I look forward to continuing our partnership through regular briefings with you and your staff, as we have done for the last three years.Thank you.nn###",

    "content": "LEUVEN – As part of the United States and European Union Trade and Technology Council (TTC) Ministerial meeting, Ambassador Katherine Tai, United States Trade Representative, and Valdis Dombrovskis, Executive Vice-President and Commissioner for Trade at the European Commissionled the principals’ meeting of the U.S.-EU tripartite Trade and Labor Dialogue (TALD) on April 4. The meeting included key U.S. and E.U. labor and business representatives and staff from the U.S. Department of Labor, DG Trade, and DG Employment, and focused on a successful, just, and inclusive green transition and future engagement under the TALD.n“Approaches to decarbonization that protect and center workers and workers’ rights should be a priority in building a green economy that is truly sustainable, resilient, durable, and inclusive,”said Ambassador Katherine Tai.“Our partnership with the European Union, and our collaboration with labor unions and business leaders, is critical for creating good-quality jobs as part of our climate policy and investments.”nThe TALD was launched at the U.S.-EU TTC Ministerial meeting in May 2021. Under the TALD, the United States and the European Union jointly consult workers’ organizations and business representatives on transatlantic trade and labor issues, especially in relation to the work of the TTC Working Group on Global Trade Challenges.nThe meeting of the TALD builds on a three-hour Transatlantic Initiative on Sustainable Trade (TIST) labor workshop hosted in January 2024, on the margins of the last TTC Ministerial, entitled “Promotion of Good Quality Jobs for a Successful, Just, and Inclusive Green Economy.” The U.S. and EU convened labor, business, and civil society to discuss the opportunities and concerns transitioning to green economies raises on both sides of the Atlantic when it comes to sustaining and creating high-quality jobs. A readout of the workshop is availablehere.nIn a previous May 2023 meeting of the TALD, union and business leaders presentedjoint recommendationson combatting forced labor in global supply chains.

    "content": "Leuven, BelgiumnI.IntroductionnThe sixth ministerial meeting of the Trade and Technology Council (“TTC”) took place in Leuven, Belgium, on 4 and 5 April 2024. It was co-chaired by European Commission Executive Vice President Margrethe Vestager, European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis, United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken, United States Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai, joined by European Commissioner Thierry Breton, and hosted by the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the European Union.nThe meeting took place against the backdrop of significant geopolitical developments and challenges, including Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine and the escalation of violence in the Middle East, that have shaken the international rules-based order to which we are jointly committed. The United States and the European Union remain unwavering in our long-term political, financial, humanitarian, and military support to Ukraine.nThere has been a buildup of global economic pressure through extensive non-market policies and practices. This accentuates excessive and possibly high-risk dependencies of strategic supplies, tilts the level playing field, and poses a threat to our economic security, our prosperity, and the well-being of our firms, workers, and citizens.nThe acceleration of the digital transformation creates unprecedented opportunities for growth and innovation but also raises numerous risks and challenges that call for accelerating our efforts to establish joint leadership and continue robust coordination on our approaches for creating rules of the road for emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), quantum technologies, and 6G wireless communication systems. We aim to foster interoperability and support our common democratic values and the protection of human rights, while also promoting innovation. We are also dedicated to continuing to equip our workforce with the skills necessary to meet the needs created by rapidly changing technology, including AI.nThe cooperation between the United States and the European Union continues to be the bedrock for dealing with such global challenges, and the TTC has played a vital role in shaping a forward-looking dialogue and facilitating unprecedented coordination and quick responses to key trade and technology related issues and developments, not least in the context of Russia’s continued aggression against Ukraine. We therefore reaffirm the importance of the TTC and will continue to refine and adapt this forum to advance our shared objectives.nWe have used the TTC to address global trade challenges, strengthen our economic and trade ties, accelerate the transition to climate-neutral economies, and boost our economic security. With the Transatlantic Initiative on Sustainable Trade (TIST), the TTC is contributing to the creation of a stronger, more sustainable, and more resilient transatlantic marketplace and facilitating environmentally responsible trade in goods and technologies. We have increased cooperation on interoperability of digital trade tools as well as standardisation of critical and emerging technologies to reduce the costs of trading across the Atlantic. To boost our economic security, we continue to cooperate through the TTC to diversify strategic supply chains, including solar panels, semiconductors, and critical raw materials, and to reduce vulnerabilities, including those caused by other countries’ non-market policies and practices. We have also deepened our dialogue and cooperation on export controls and investment screening.nWorking with stakeholders, we continue to use the TTC to advance the governance of critical and emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, semiconductors, biotechnology, and online platforms, including by supporting the development of rights-respecting international technical standards, codes of conduct, principles, and guidance. In particular, we call upon online platforms to ensure their services contribute to an environment that protects, empowers, and respects their users and the general public. We are working together to advance public interest research on online platforms, including to address particular societal risks, such as technology-facilitated gender-based violence. We will continue to combat foreign information manipulation and interference and to protect human rights defenders online, including in the context of elections.nWe intend to continue our trade and technology cooperation as set out below.nII. Key Outcomes of the Sixth TTC Ministerial MeetingnA. Advancing Transatlantic Leadership on Critical and Emerging Technologies Artificial IntelligencenThe United States and the European Union reaffirm our commitment to a risk-based approach to artificial intelligence (AI) and to advancing safe, secure, and trustworthy AI technologies. The dedicated coordination under the TTC continues to be instrumental to implementing our respective policy approaches which aim to reap the potential benefits of AI while protecting individuals and, society against its potential risks, and upholding human rights.nOur exchanges confirm our joint understanding that transparency and risk mitigation are key elements to ensure the safe, secure, and trustworthy development and use of AI, and we will continue to coordinate our contributions to multilateral initiatives such as the G7, the OECD, G20, Council of Europe, and UN processes to advance the responsible stewardship of AI. We encourage advanced AI developers in the United States and Europe to further the application of the Hiroshima Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems which complements our respective governance and regulatory systems.nWith a view to ensuring continued and impactful cooperation on AI, leaders from the European AI Office and the U.S. AI Safety Institute have briefed one another on their respective approaches and mandates. These institutions today committed to establishing a Dialogue to deepen their collaboration, particularly to foster scientific information exchange among their respective scientific entities and affiliates on topics such as, benchmarks, potential risks, and future technological trends.nThis cooperation will contribute to making progress with the implementation of theJoint Roadmap on Evaluation and Measurement Tools for Trustworthy AI and Risk Management, which is essential to minimize divergence as appropriate in our respective emerging AI governance and regulatory systems, and to cooperate on interoperable and international standards. Following stakeholder consultations, we have further developed a list of key AI terms with mutually accepted joint definitions and published anupdated version.nWe are also united in our belief of the potential of AI to address some of the world’s greatest challenges. We applaud the United Nations General Assembly Plenary Resolution “Seizing the Opportunities of Safe, Secure and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence Systems for Sustainable Development,” that has solidified a global consensus around the need to manage the risks of AI while harnessing its benefits for sustainable development and the protection and promotion of human rights.nWe are advancing on the promise of AI for sustainable development in our bilateral relationship through joint research cooperation as part of the administrative arrangement on artificial intelligence and computing to address global challenges for the public good. Working groups jointly staffed by U.S. science agencies and European Commission departments and agencies have achieved substantial progress by definingcritical milestones for deliverables in the areas of extreme weather, energy, emergency response, and reconstruction. We are also making constructive progress in health and agriculture.nWe will continue to explore opportunities with our partners in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany in the AI for Development Donor Partnership to accelerate and align our foreign assistance in Africa to support educators, entrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens to harness the promise of AI.nQuantumnThe United States and the European Union established a Quantum Task Force to address open questions on science and technology cooperation between the United States and the European Union on quantum technologies. Its primary objective is to bridge gaps in research and development (R&D) between the United States and the European Union, thereby harmonizing efforts in quantum technology advancements. This includes the establishment of a shared understanding and approach to technology readiness levels, development of unified benchmarks, identification of critical components in quantum technology, and advancement of international standards.nThe task force continues work to address key questions that are necessary to reach an agreement on launching joint actions for science and technology cooperation in quantum, such as reciprocity in openness of quantum research programs and in intellectual property rights regimes.nPost-Quantum Cryptography CoordinationnThe United States and the European Union affirm the importance of the rapid mobilization to secure our digital communication networks against the threats posed by the potential for a future cryptanalytically-relevant quantum computer. Our joint work in Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC), feeding into the U.S-EU Cyber Dialogue, enables U.S. and EU partners to share information to understand activities in PQC standardization and in the transition to PQC.nThe Road to 6GnThe United States and the European Union share the belief that advanced connectivity can facilitate a more inclusive, sustainable, and secure global economy. We concur on shared principles for the research and development of 6G wireless communication systems, and we recognize that by working together we can support the development of technologies and global technical standards for tomorrow’s critical digital infrastructure that reflect shared principles and values. We support open, global, market-driven, and inclusive multi-stakeholder approaches for the development of technical standards for secure and interoperable telecommunications equipment and services. On the road to 6G, in a geopolitical environment increasingly marked by tension and conflict, the growing requirement for security and resilience of key enabling communications technologies and critical infrastructure highlights the need to rely on trusted suppliers, to prevent vulnerabilities and dependencies, with potential downstream effects on the entire industrial ecosystem.nWe delivered a 6G outlook in May 2023. In addition, the two main industry associations on each side of the Atlantic jointly developed a6G Industry Roadmapin December 2023. The roadmap affirmed the commitment of the stakeholders to collaborate on the development of 6G networks and proposed a comprehensive set of critical strategic reflections and recommendations from academia and industry. On 26 February 2024, ten countries, including some EU Member States concluded ajoint statement on 6G.nThese milestones have contributed to shaping the joint “6G vision” that we are adopting today. This vision focuses on technology challenges and research collaboration including on microelectronics; AI and cloud solutions for 6G; security and resilience; affordability and inclusiveness, sustainability and energy efficiency; openness and interoperability; efficient radio spectrum usage; and the standardisation process.nHaving decided on this 6G vision, the United States and the European Union will strengthen cooperation between their research and innovation funding agencies, notably through an Administrative Arrangement signed between the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Directorate‑General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG Connect) of the European Commission covering collaboration in the field of 6G and Next Generation Internet technologies.nConsidering the importance of developing a common vision to 6G and cooperating in the global standardisation process through standardisation organisations such as ETSI/3GPP, we also intend to develop an outreach plan with likeminded partners to support and advance the development of 6G networks.nSemiconductorsnThe coordination on our respective efforts to build resilient semiconductor supply chains remains crucial to the secure supply of semiconductors, which are indispensable inputs to an ever-growing range of key industry sectors, and to ensure leadership in cutting-edge technologies.nWe have been cooperating fruitfully under two administrative arrangements:nWe intend to extend the two administrative arrangements for a period of three years to enable further coordination and to establish synergies between our support for investments in the semiconductor sector taking place under the EU Chips Act and the U.S. CHIPS Act.nThe United States and the European Union share concerns about non-market economic policies and practices that may lead to distortionary effects or excessive dependencies for mature node (“legacy”) semiconductors. On the side of the fifth TTC ministerial meeting, which took place on 30 January 2024 in Washington, D.C., we held a joint roundtable with high-level industry representatives dedicated to legacy semiconductor supply chains. Both the United States and the European Union are committed to continuing to engage closely with industry on the issue. We plan to convene further government-to-government discussions with like-minded countries on this topic in the near future. In January 2024, the United States launched an industry survey to assess the use of legacy chips in supply chains that directly or indirectly support U.S. national security and critical infrastructure. The European Union is also gathering information on this issue. We intend to, as appropriate, continue to collect and share non-confidential information and market intelligence about non-market policies and practices, commit to consult each other on planned actions, and may develop joint or cooperative measures to address distortionary effects on the global supply chain for legacy semiconductors.nWe plan to continue working to identify research cooperation opportunities on alternatives to the use of per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS) in chips. For example, we plan to explore the use of AI capacities and digital twins to accelerate the discovery of suitable materials to replace PFAS in semiconductor manufacturing.nBiotechnology Cooperation to Promote the Bioeconomy and Address Global ChallengesnThe bioeconomy is supported by the use of foundational and widely-applicable tools and technologies (including emerging biotechnologies), which have the potential to drive innovation to address global challenges. .These tools and technologies also represent an opportunity to begin developing a common international understanding of the bioeconomy and future efforts to evaluate, measure, and grow the global bioeconomy as a whole. A crucial component of this effort is establishing a shared understanding of some of the risks and vulnerabilities associated with the bioeconomy, including economic and security considerations, alongside a simultaneous commitment to enabling the safe, secure, sustainable, and responsible use of tools and technologies for bioeconomic development.nWe look forward to cooperating on shared research, development, and innovation priorities through the U.S.-EU Joint Consultative Group that will push bioeconomic development forward in ways that address the most pressing global challenges we all face.nWe acknowledge the significant promise and risks associated with the integration of advanced biotechnology with other technological disciplines such as AI, information technology, nanotechnology, neurotechnology, chemistry, and medicine, which will drive innovation and have significant implications for academia, industry, and economic security. To address the potential risks associated with the convergence of these technologies, we are committed to work toward mechanisms to safeguard dual-use advanced biotechnology items and equipment.nTransatlantic Cooperation on Standards for Critical and Emerging Technologies and Clean Energy TransitionnThe United States and the European Union share an interest in recognizing mutually compatible technical standards as a way to expand transatlantic approaches for the deployment of critical and emerging technologies that reflect our shared values.nWe plan to continue to exchange information on international standardisation activities for critical and emerging technologies via the “Strategic Standardisation Information (SSI)” mechanism, as established at the second U.S-EU TTC ministerial meeting. Our deepened cooperation enables us to cooperate on global standards. In order to strengthen collaboration with the private sector, we organised ajoint stakeholder workshopin Washington D.C. on 17 November 2023, which identified relevant areas for transatlantic collaboration.nTogether with standards development organisations and stakeholders, we have endeavoured to work towards mutually compatible standards and best practices in areas of strategic interest with the objective of avoiding unnecessarily burdensome technical trade barriers, without prejudice to the specificities and needs of our respective legal systems.nOver the last two years, our cooperation has led to tangible outcomes. We have facilitated commonly recognised international standards for the rollout of megawatt charging systems for heavy-duty vehicle charging points, and joint work of U.S. and EU standardisation bodies on plastics recycling and additive manufacturing since the start of the TTC. Our work continues to facilitate the development of mutually recognised and compatible standards to enhance new opportunities for cooperation within our respective standardisation systems.nFollowing a successful round of government-to-government technical exchanges, the European Commission and U.S. government released a Digital Identity Mapping Exercise ReportDigital Identity Mapping Exercise Reportwhich provides the results of an initial mapping centred on the definitions, assurance levels, and references to international standards included across Revision 3 of the NIST Digital Identity Guidelines (Special Publication 800-63, Revision 3) and European Regulation(EU) No 910/2014on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market. The next phase of this project will focus on identifying potential use cases for transatlantic interoperability and cooperation with a view toward enabling the cross-border use of digital identities and wallets.nThe United States and the European Union intend to continue to identify emerging technology standards that are enablers of the clean energy transition for transatlantic collaboration.nB. Promoting Sustainability and New Opportunities for Trade and InvestmentnTransatlantic Initiative on Sustainable TradenThe Transatlantic Initiative on Sustainable Trade (TIST) work programme, which we launched at the fourth U.S-EU TTC ministerial meeting in May 2023, has advanced our cooperation on actions to accelerate the transition to climate-neutral economies in the United States and the European Union in a mutually beneficial way. The United States and the European Union have been making progress on the different work strands under the TIST work programme and will continue to advance this work.nBuilding a Transatlantic Green MarketplacenBuilding on our strong economic links to accelerate the green transition while creating new business opportunities for our firms and good employment opportunities for our citizens is a key objective of the TIST.nOn 30-31 January 2024, the United States and the European Union jointly organised the “Crafting the Transatlantic Green Marketplace” event in Washington, D.C. The event brought together representatives from the U.S. and EU business, civil society, and labor communities to engage in a series of thematic stakeholder-led discussions that focused on identifying opportunities for transatlantic collaboration to promote the transition to a more sustainable and climate-neutral economy on both sides of the Atlantic. The United States and the European Union thank the participants for their time and input. We are currently analysing the various proposals for cooperation received from the stakeholders to assess their potential to be taken forward.nIn addition, the United States and the European Union will continue various efforts under the TIST umbrella, including exploring potential avenues of cooperation on conformity assessment.nGreen Public ProcurementnThe United States and the European Union underscore that, by achieving a common understanding on green public procurement practices, we can accelerate the uptake of more sustainable and greener solutions to achieve our common environmental and climate goals.nTo this end, we have issued aJoint U.S.-EU Catalogue of Best Practices on Green Public Procurement. It will contribute to advancing sustainability objectives by identifying and promoting policy tools for accelerating the deployment of publicly financed sustainability projects in the United States and the European Union.nThe Joint Catalogue presents a collection of policies, practices, and actions used across all stages of the procurement process, from the strategic planning to pre-procurement, procurement, and post-contract award stage, and addresses all types of environmental and climate challenges, such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency or promoting circular economy approaches. It can serve as an inspiration for policymakers and suppliers, as well as provide ideas for the uptake of green solutions in public procurement globally.nThe United States and the European Union will continue to work together on how to use the Joint Catalogue and maximise its impact.nSecure and Sustainable Supply Chains for the Clean Energy TransitionnThe United States and the European Union reaffirm that secure and sustainable transatlantic supply chains are key for a solid and steadfast transition towards a net zero economy and will help reduce excessive dependencies in strategic economic activities. We intend to continue to cooperate on strategic supply chains, such as solar, to help us increase secure supply of clean energy. The United States and the European Union share common challenges in the solar sector and reaffirm the importance of a dedicated workstream that explores ways to jointly support our photovoltaic manufacturing capacity (including equipment) and to diversify and de-risk this supply chain.nThe United States and the European Union also continue efforts to promote transparency and traceability to improve social standards and environmental protections across supply chains that support the green transition. In this context, we are planning a workshop with stakeholders to present ongoing initiatives to promote innovative solutions in the management of sustainable supply chains, including a focused session on solar.nU.S-EU Clean Energy Incentives DialoguenThe United States and the European Union share a strong commitment to tackling the climate crisis. We want to further the growth of the global clean energy economy while establishing resilient, secure, and diverse clean energy supply chains. By strengthening and expanding clean energy industries and investing in future-oriented sectors, we generate jobs, ignite a positive cycle of innovation, and decrease costs for clean energy technologies.nThrough the U.S-EU Clean Energy Incentives Dialogue, we continue to work in a transparent and mutually reinforcing manner, to avoid zero-sum competition, subsidy races and distortions in transatlantic trade and investment flows that could arise from our respective policies and incentives. In this way, we strive to maximise clean energy technology deployment that creates jobs and does not lead to windfalls for private interests. To further enhance transparency, we intend to share specific information about our respective public incentive programs starting with one sector as a pilot with the possibility to extend this to further sectors in the future and will explore putting in place a reciprocal mechanism for consultations.nWe share concerns about a range of third country non-market policies and practices. We have discussed thoseused by certain third countries to attain a dominant global position in clean energy sectors, and recognise the value of continuing to exchange information on such non-market policies and practices. We will continue to explore policy tools and possible coordinated action to address harm caused by these policies and practices. including by fostering supply chain diversification, reducing dependencies, and building resilience to economic coercion.nCritical MineralsnThe United States and the European Union affirm their close collaboration on diversifying global critical minerals supply chains. We welcome the launch of theMineral Security Partnership (MSP) Forum, which we will co-chair. The MSP Forum will formalize and expand its existing engagements with minerals producing countries, with a particular focus on advancing and accelerating individual projects with high environmental protections and social governance and labor standards and promoting discussion of policies that contribute to diverse and resilient supply chains.nContinuing our well-established cooperation on critical raw materials, a workshop on “Developing the permanent magnets value chain” resulted in valuable exchanges focussing on rare earth magnets. We plan to continue these exchanges in the future.nTo promote a green transition, enhance economic security, and strengthen environmental protections and labor rights in international critical minerals supply chains, the United States and the European Union are advancing negotiations toward a Critical Minerals Agreement.nTransatlantic E-Mobility CooperationnWe welcome the successful completion of theElectro-mobility and Interoperability with Smart Gridsworkstream with the publication of the U.S-EU joint technical recommendations for “Future Public Demonstrations of Vehicle-Grid Integration (VGI) Pilots”. Devised in consultation with industry experts and stakeholders, the recommendations propose the development of best practices to prepare for large-scale VGI demonstrations, educate potential customers, and incorporate requisite customer-related factors in demonstration programme designs, and aim at supporting communication and coordination between the United States and the EU.nThe recommendations complement the “Transatlantic Technical Recommendations for Government Funded Implementation of Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure,” which were presented at the fourth TTC ministerial meeting in May 2023 in Luleå, Sweden.nTogether, the two sets of recommendations can benefit companies and end users, and transatlantic trade and investment, by supporting the expansion of e-mobility as well as the realization of U.S. and EU clean energy and de-carbonization commitments.nEnhancing eInvoicing Interoperability between the United States and the European UnionnAs part of our efforts to increase the use of digital tools that enhance trade, Electronic Invoicing (eInvoicing) has emerged as a transformative tool in modern business, offering efficiency gains, cost savings, and trade benefits. The continued cooperation and efforts towards compatible eInvoicing between the United States and the European Union. offer a spectrum of advantages, with the potential to significantly reshape cross-market transactions and the dynamics of transatlantic trade. Even though most of the eInvoicing technical specifications and profiles are highly aligned, there are differences between our respective eInvoicing systems. We intend to continue to cooperate and coordinate for greater compatibility, particularly in terms of business and technical interoperability, as outlined in the declaration annexed to this Joint Statement.nTrade and Labor in the Green TransitionnToday, the United States and the European Union held their third session of the tripartite Transatlantic Trade and Labor Dialogue (TALD). This session brought together TTC principals and senior representatives from labor, business, and government from both sides of the Atlantic and continued the joint transatlantic work with social partners on the promotion of sustainable and responsible supply chains with strong protections for labor rights. Building on the discussions during the workshop on the “Promotion of Good Quality Jobs for a Successful, Just and Inclusive Green Transition” on 30 January 2024, the TALD meeting provided the opportunity to dive deeper and hear views from labor and business stakeholders on the topic of the green transition, with specific focus on the green transition and other challenges, and the future of TALD.nIn addition, the United States and the European Union reaffirmed their commitment to cooperate to eliminate forced labor from global supply chains, as called upon in the labor and businesses stakeholders’ May 2023 joint recommendations, and they expressed the intention to continue technical dialogue to exchange information, as well as share best practices regarding the implementation of their forced labor policies, including with regard to research and risk assessment.nC. Trade, Security, and Economic ProsperitynTrade for Economic SecuritynStrengthening our economic security is a fundamental pillar of the transatlantic partnership. The TTC has helped provide a better understanding of our respective approaches to economic security. We intend to continue cooperation under the TTC to address common challenges using relevant trade and technology tools, bilaterally and in relevant fora, including the G7 and the World Trade Organization. We reaffirm shared concerns about the challenges posed to our economic security by, among other issues, economic coercion, the weaponization of economic dependencies, and the use of non-market policies and practices by third countries. We share the objective of continuing efforts to de-risk and diversify our trade and investment relations, including by reducing critical and excessive dependencies and strengthening the resilience of strategic supply chains.nCooperation on Export Controls and Sanction-Related Export RestrictionsnWe continue to recognise the important role played by the TTC in supporting the European Union, the United States, and other international partners in their unprecedented cooperation on measures against Russia and Belarus. Such cooperation has helped bring about a continuous alignment of our regulations and a consistent application of export restrictions targeting Russia and Belarus through, for example, regular exchanges of information about authorisation and denial decisions. It has also supported coordination to counter the circumvention of our measures, such as through the creation and update of a common list of high priority items (CHP) and our outreach to industry.nWe will continue to work to further align U.S. and EU priorities on Russian export restrictions and coordinated international messaging on those priorities to combat circumvention and improve efficiency and effectiveness of domestic controls. As regards the implementation of export restrictions against Russia, both sides welcome the setting up of the platform for the exchange of licensing information and plan to continue to exchange information on outreach activities, including to third countries and industry.nBoth sides have also decided to continue work on facilitating secure high-technology trade and reducing administrative burdens in areas covered by export controls by developing a common understanding of respective rules and mapping out measures that would help streamline this trade, while maintaining a well-functioning and effective export control regime. For example, the United States has expanded licencing exceptions to EU Member States.nWe welcome the impulse the TTC has given to coordinated action by the United States and the European Union in reaching out to other countries and supporting them in strengthening their export controls, for example, through the provision of secure software for the processing of licenses.nInvestment ScreeningnWe reiterate the importance of having effective foreign direct investment (FDI) screening mechanisms in place aimed at addressing national security risks in the United States and addressing threats to security and public order in the European Union. We welcome the progress in this regard and will continue to support the development and implementation of these mechanisms, while promoting an open and attractive investment environment.nWe have carried out joint work to identify certain best practices on foreign direct investment screening with the intention to eventually bring these to the attention of screening authorities and stakeholders more broadly. We will soon launch of a joint repository that will provide additional resources to U.S. and EU Member State investment screening professionals. We have deepened our cooperation on investment screening through hosting a public stakeholder event and conducting outreach to like-minded partners in the Western Balkans to support their development of effective FDI screening mechanisms and intend to continue such outreach in 2024.nWe will continue our cooperation on investment screening through technical exchanges, including on investment trends impacting security risks related to specific sensitive technologies to provide a better understanding of similarities and differences in approach.nOutbound Investment SecuritynWe recognize the importance of investment, innovation, and open economies. At the same time, we are also attentive to concerns regarding potential security threats and risks to international peace and security that may arise from certain outbound investments in a narrow set of critical technologies. Against this background, the United States and the European Union will continue to exchange information on the security risks, risk analyses, and on our respective approaches around this issue, and how to address this new challenge.nAddressing Non-Market Policies and PracticesnThe United States and the European Union remain concerned about the persistent use of other countries’ non-market policies and practices and the challenge they pose both to our workers and businesses and to other third-country markets. We continue to exchange on the risks that non-market policies and practices, including non-market excess capacity, pose in certain sectors and to engage with partners where appropriate.nWe engaged with other countries who share our concerns about China’s non-market policies and practices in the medical devices sector, and conveyed these concerns directly to China. The United States and the European Union will continue to monitor developments in the medical devices sector.nD. Defending Human Rights and Values in a Changing Geopolitical Digital EnvironmentnProtecting Information Integrity in a Pivotal Year for Democratic ResiliencenThe United States and the European Union reiterate our unwavering commitment to support democracies across the world. We are determined to defend human rights and will continue to call out authoritarianism. In a year marked by democratic elections around the world, we call upon all actors including governments, industry, journalists, human rights defenders, and civil society to protect and defend information integrity both online and offline.nWe express our strong support for the role of free, pluralistic, and independent media in protecting information integrity. Independent media should serve as a public watchdog and a key pillar of democracy, as well as an important and dynamic part of our economy. We recognize its indispensable role informing public opinion, fact-checking, and holding those in power accountable.nWe are witnessing rapid technological advancements which provide opportunities to enhance information integrity but also create new risks. The United States and the European Union share the concern that malign use of AI applications, such as the creation of harmful “deepfakes,” poses new risks, including to further the spread and targeting of foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI). We call upon technology companies and online platforms to uphold information integrity, including in the run-up to elections across the world.nIn the European Union, the Digital Services Act (DSA) requires designated very large online platforms and search engines to assess and mitigate societal risks emanating from their services, including negative effects on civic discourse and electoral processes and recommends specific measures, including on generative AI content.nCooperation on Online PlatformsnThe United States and the European Union reaffirm their view that online platforms should exercise greater responsibility in ensuring that their services contribute to an online environment that protects, empowers, and respects their users. We reiterate that online platforms should take appropriate actions to address the impact of their services on the mental health and development of children and youth.nThe United States and the European Union also reaffirm that urgent action is needed to address technology-facilitated gender-based violence, which disproportionately impacts women and girls, who often experience multiple and intersecting discriminations and oppressions. We developed a set ofjoint principles on combatting gender-based violence on online platformsthat complement further the jointhigh-level principleson the protection and empowerment of children and youth and facilitation of data access from online platforms for independent research, which were released at the fourth TTC ministerial meeting.nIn addition to releasing these principles, we are also publishing astatus reporton mechanisms for researcher access to online platform data, which builds upon efforts undertaken by the academic and research community. The aim of this work is to disseminate information about the new and improved possibilities now available to study and understand systemic risks related to online platforms. We call on online platforms to expand and improve access for researchers, particularly on societal risks.nTo deepen this work, in the margins of this Ministerial Meeting, we organized a joint workshop on access to platform data and using this data to combat technology-facilitated gender-based violence. We invited, and continue to encourage, the research community to analyse these data access mechanisms, and to explore how they can contribute to a better understanding of the functioning of – and the potential risks emanating from online platforms with regard to areas such as the mental health and development of children and youth, and technology-facilitated gender-based violence.nWe share the commitment to the highest appropriate standards of protection in these areas for users in both the United States and the European Union.nProtecting Human Rights Defenders OnlinenThe United States and the European Union recognise the key role human rights defenders (HRDs) play in defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, and we are committed to the protection of HRDs online and offline. We are working together to address human rights risks stemming from the misuse of digital technologies, including combatting internet shutdowns, unlawful surveillance, and the targeting of HRDs online. Elevating the critical role of HRDs and supporting and protecting them in doing their work safely is not only a shared foreign policy priority for the United States and the European Union, but an imperative for advancing human rights for all.nFollowing the commitment made at the fourth TTC ministerial meeting, we have published jointRecommended Actions for Online Platforms on Protecting Human Rights Defenders Online. This document sets out ten recommendations that online platforms can take globally to prevent, mitigate, and provide remedy for attacks against HRDs online.nThese recommendations reflect commitments we made with global partners through the Declaration of the Future of the Internet and reflect key principles of U.S. and EU legislation, initiatives, and policies to safeguard human rights online. They were informed by extensive stakeholder consultations organized by the United States and the European Union from January 2023 to February 2024. The United States and the European Union intend to take further actions to address the needs of HRDs around the world. We will engage with all relevant stakeholders to promote the recommended actions and facilitate their implementation. We will also facilitate further exchanges and cooperation between the European Union- and United States-based emergency mechanisms on support strategies which seek to prevent, curb, mitigate, and eliminate online attacks, including the use of arbitrary and unlawful surveillance targeting HRDs.nForeign Information Manipulation and Interference in Third CountriesnThe United States and the European Union consider foreign information manipulation and interference (FIMI) to be geopolitical and security challenges. We share the aim of addressing this threat and enhancing the resilience of democracies. Against this background, we have taken a number of actions to increase transatlantic cooperation to proactively address FIMI, including disinformation, while upholding human rights and fundamental freedoms. We will continue to work together to address FIMI through the TTC and other multi- and bilateral contexts.nWe will continue to jointly use and further advancethe common analytical methodology to identify, analyse and detect FIMIdecided at the fourth TTC ministerial meeting. We are engaging with other international partners on a quarterly basis to familiarise them with this methodology. Expanding the network of partners familiar with this methodology will enhance our common understanding of the threat and allow us to jointly identify, analyse, and counter FIMI globally.nThe European Union, the United States, and the Western Balkan partners share the same vision for an open, reliable, and secure Internet, as evidenced by their joint endorsement of the Declaration for the Future of the Internet. We will coordinate our efforts in order to support the Western Balkan partners by launching a coordination mechanism to address FIMI threats more effectively in the region. This is in line with the European Union’s and like-minded partners’ initiatives to increase their capabilities to further identify, assess, and counter FIMI. Our support will reduce third countries’, and in particular Russia’s and other actors’, including China’s, ability to effectively employ FIMI campaigns in the region. We will help our partners in the Western Balkans to develop capacity in five key action areas: the development of national strategies and policies, the creation of dedicated governance structures and institutions, increasing human and technical capabilities, protecting and supporting the role of independent media, academia, and civil society, and multilateral engagement.nSecure and Trusted Digital Infrastructure and Connectivity in Third CountriesnThe United States and the European Union reiterate the importance of and support for secure, trusted, and resilient digital connectivity and information and communication technology and services (ICTS) supply chains in third countries, provided by trusted suppliers.nWe commend the decisions taken by partner countries towards trusted ICT ecosystems by ensuring high cybersecurity and resilience standards for connectivity solutions and networks, including by restricting or excluding high-risk suppliers from their national networks and using trusted vendors and services providers for maintenance and repair.nWe will continue to reach out to partners across the world to understand the needs and challenges around securing digital infrastructure and explore how we can best collaborate to support the digitalisation goals of emerging economies. We continue to engage emerging economies through technical discussions and high-level roundtables to increase interest in secure digital connectivity. We also remain committed to continued exchanges with relevant industry actors such as mobile network operators and trusted equipment suppliers.nWe are delivering on our commitments to support to secure and resilient connectivity projects in Costa Rica, Jamaica, Kenya, and the Philippines, including through mechanisms like the Global Gateway, the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment, and technical exchanges, including third counties sharing experiences to accelerate secure connectivity in other parts of the region.nThe United States and the European Union are supporting Tunisia’s goal of establishing secure digital connectivity and infrastructure by relying on trusted vendors through collaborative advocacy, technical assistance and by exploring financing, coordination, and policy alignment. This includes providing training programs to targeted Tunisian government agencies, IT professionals, and businesses, and promoting the development of cybersecurity standards and frameworks, in particular for 5G. The United States and the European Union are advancing discussions with relevant financial institutions for the mobilisation of support for secure digital connectivity infrastructure projects with trusted vendors.nWe aim to continue our actions to support secure and resilient digital connectivity in third countries. Following the earlier signing of a memorandum of understanding between the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), the United States and the European Union intend to augment their actions by furthering cooperation between the EU Member State and United States financing agencies. In 2023, the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) signed co-financing memorandums of understanding with the Swedish EKN and Finnish Finnvera respectively to facilitate joint support for export projects, and has enabled direct support to trusted suppliers from both sides.nWe are committed to exploring options to act strategically, cooperatively, and efficiently to provide attractive incentives to partner countries to choose trusted suppliers for the development of their connectivity networks.nSecure and Resilient International ConnectivitynThe United States and the European Union recall the economic and geostrategic importance of cooperating on trust and security in the entirety of ICT infrastructure, including maintenance and repair. To this end, we continue to seek ways to advance cooperation on international connectivity with trustworthy, secure, and resilient networks. This could include trans-oceanic routes including through the Arctic and Pacific regions.nIII. Building the Transatlantic Partnership Together with StakeholdersnWe remain committed to high levels of transparency and the close involvement of the transatlantic stakeholder community at large in the work of the TTC, including businesses, labor organisations, non-profit organisations, environmental constituencies, and academics.nWe have therefore extensively reached out to stakeholders and given them the possibility to be involved and to provide input and receive feedback through the organisation of events, roundtables, and workshops and the establishment of dedicated websites likeFuturium. With the support of the EU-financed Trade and Technology Dialogue, several high-level events have taken place and stakeholders have been consulted on topics such as sustainable trade, standardisation, AI, connectivity, and semiconductors.nIn addition to these activities, we have also engaged with relevant stakeholders in more structured formats such as the Transatlantic Trade and Labor Dialogue, the Talent for Growth Task Force, and with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in a series of webinars on the topic of SME access to and use of digital tools.nTalent for GrowthnThe Talent for Growth Task Force, launched in April 2023 with a one-year mandate, has served both as a platform for best practices and a catalyst for innovative skills approaches that promote economic growth and create opportunities for workers in the technology sector. The Task Force brought together leaders from government, business, labor unions, and organisations that support training from the United States and the European Union. The Task Force identified, mapped, and disseminated implementable models and ideas in four critical areas: training workers to meet business needs, including women and underrepresented groups in technical jobs, Moving to a skills-first culture, and micro-credentials.The Task Force endorsed astatementfeaturing key messages stemming from these discussions.nThe discussions in this group have confirmed the critical role talent plays for the sustainable growth of our economies and the well-being of our societies in an age of rapidly changing technology. It examined the acceleration of change brought about by AI. The Task Force has established bilateral relations between Task Force members which have catalysed private-sector initiatives and will last beyond the timeframe of the Task Force. The European and the United States remain dedicated to continuing to equip our workforces with the skills necessary to meet the needs created by rapidly changing technology, including AI.nSmall and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs)nThe United States and the European Union recognise the use of digital tools as a key enabler for SMEs to innovate, grow, and compete and are continuing their work to promote the uptake of digital technologies by SMEs.nSeveral webinars and outreach activities where SMEs shared their needs and experience were held during the last two years. After an analysis of these stakeholder exchanges, we have developed acommon set of recommendationsfor U.S. and EU policymakers to implement measures to help SMEs to accelerate access to these technologies.nThe recommendations focus on the topics of digital-related trainings; transatlantic exchange programmes; information-sharing on cyber-security, intellectual property, and standards; and access to finance. To continue the work, we intend to develop an implementation process for these recommendations, including measures such as a webinar on access to finance and the publishing of cross-referenced U.S. and EU websites with practical information for SMEs.nIV. Conclusion and Next StepsnSince its inaugural meeting on 29 September 2021, the TTC has realized substantial progress and achievements across all workstreams. These results have enabled the United States and the European Union: to explore how to create new trade and investment opportunities, notably to contribute to the green transition; to advance our shared leadership in emerging technologies, such as 6G, quantum, and biotechnology so that democracies can remain at the vanguard of these developments; to provide a robust joint response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine; to cooperate on economic security measures to reduce economic dependencies; to continue to develop a shared understanding of the non-market policies and practices and the risks they pose or our workers, businesses and markets globally; to jointly enhance supply chain resilience while promoting transparency and cooperation on our industrial policy approaches in key sectors, including semiconductors and clean energy; to exchange information on best practices in eliminating forced labor from our global supply chains; to advance and reinforce interoperability between AI governance frameworks based on our shared democratic values to achieve our common vision for safe, secure, and trustworthy AI globally ; to advance the resilience and security of our ICT infrastructures; and to finance and promote secure connectivity with trusted suppliers around the world.nThese achievements demonstrate the enduring ties between the United States and the European Union and the importance of maintaining an operational forum for cooperation on strategic trade and technology issues of common interest and geopolitical relevance. As the United States and the European Union enter their respective electoral processes, the work we do under the TTC will remain relevant, strategic, and timely, while allowing for the necessary flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances.nBuilding on the lessons learned from our cooperation so far, we intend to use the remainder of 2024 to engage with U.S. and EU stakeholders to learn their views on the future of the TTC.n",

TheU.S. Communication, “Understanding the Opportunities and Challenges of the Green Transition: Coherence and Interoperability of Trade-Related Climate Measures,” is intended to advance discussions among WTO Members on practical and constructive ways that trade policies can support and complement WTO Members’ efforts to address climate change. TheU.S. Communicationrecognizes that countries are already implementing trade-related climate measures and that approaches will vary across countries based on their own unique circumstances. It proposes that discussions at the WTO should focus on how these different policies can complement each other, to the extent possible, and avoid working at cross purposes. It identifies certain areas of climate-related discussions which are more advanced at the WTO and can be deepened and lead to positive outcomes. TheU.S. Communicationalso encourages WTO Members to draw upon work already underway in other international bodies to avoid duplication of efforts. USTR will use the communication to engage other WTO Members on constructive and practical ways to leverage discussions at the WTO to advance our mutual goals to address climate change.nThe U.S. Communication can be foundhere.nn###",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai today released the 2024 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers (NTE Report), which provides a comprehensive review of significant foreign barriers to U.S. exports of goods and services, U.S. foreign direct investment, and U.S. electronic commerce in key export markets for the United States.“Statute provides that the NTE Report identify significant barriers to trade and investment, for the U.S. government to use to open those markets. As in years past, USTR is using this year’s NTE Report as a part of the Biden-Harris Administration’s trade policy tool kit to open markets for hardworking American workers, farmers, ranchers, small businesses, and communities,” said Ambassador Tai.“The NTE Report has received unprecedented attention this year because we are taking steps to return it to its stated statutory purpose. We respect that each government—including our own—has the sovereign right to govern in the public interest and to regulate for legitimate public policy reasons. Over the years, the NTE Report expanded from its statutory purpose to include measures without regard to whether they may be valid exercises of sovereign policy authority. Examples include efforts by South Africa to render its economy more equitable in the post-Apartheid era; import licensing requirements for narcotics and explosives; and restrictions on imports of endangered species. By carefully editing and returning the NTE Report to the statute’s intent, USTR is making it a more useful document that enumerates significant trade barriers that could be addressed to expand market opportunities and help our economy grow.“The NTE Report has been, is, and will always be a work in progress, and we welcome input from all our stakeholders. We recognize that American trade policy must reflect the values of the American people.”Published annually since 1985, this year’s NTE Report covers significant foreign trade barriers in 59 markets. Examples of these significant barriers include:nnnnnThe 2024 NTE Report can be viewedhere.The release of the 2024 NTE Report follows the March 1, 2024 release of the 2024 President’s Trade Policy Agenda and 2023 Annual Report.

The virtual meeting focused on implementation of the Leaders’ guidance related to trade and investment and plans for an in-person Trade Ministerial Meeting this year.nThe Ministers emphasized how the Americas Partnership can complement and build on existing trade ties, further deepen economic integration in the region, and develop sustainable and inclusive approaches to trade and investment. They also recalled Leaders’ expectation that the trade agenda under the Americas Partnership create formal jobs that lead to decent work and promote internationally recognized labor rights, environmental sustainability, and economic inclusion. The Ministers reiterated the importance of timely implementation of Leaders’ priorities, including work on trade facilitation and digitalization of customs procedures; conducting a gap analysis of value and supply chains in the critical sectors of clean energy, semiconductors, and medical supplies; and developing activities to promote greater access to the benefits of trade for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and underserved communities.During the meeting, the Ministers received a progress update on these priorities from the Senior Officials of the Council on Trade and Competitiveness (CTC), including the establishment of committees on Trade Rules and Transparency, Sustainable Value and Supply Chains, and Inclusive Trade and SMEs, and their ongoing technical work. The Ministers took note of the work already underway and directed the CTC to maximize efforts in light of the Second Leaders’ Summit to be held in Costa Rica in 2025, including by ensuring that the technical leads for all committees and working groups have been identified and hold their first meetings as soon as possible.nRecognizing the ambitious regional goals of the Americas Partnership, the Ministers also directed the CTC to actively consider priorities for 2025. Ministers stressed the importance of broad and inclusive stakeholder engagement in developing projects for the trade work of the Americas Partnership and encouraged the CTC to continue its exchange of information on approaches to stakeholder engagement and best practices to promote inclusivity.Ministers reiterated their commitment to making the Americas Partnership a durable structure for regional cooperation on trade and investment issues and welcomed Ecuador’s offer to host an in-person Trade Ministerial Meeting of the Americas Partnership this summer.nn###",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai today participated in the first meeting of ministers responsible for trade under the Americas Partnership for Economic Prosperity (“Americas Partnership”). In her opening remarks, Ambassador Tai underscored the importance of the Americas Partnership Trade Track in building a durable and inclusive regional economy, including by bolstering supply chain resilience, empowering workers, and tackling the climate crisis.Ambassador Tai’s remarks, as prepared for delivery, are below:Hello, everyone. It is great to see all of you. Welcome to the first trade ministers meeting of the Americas Partnership.I have had the pleasure to meet many of you in different fora – in bilateral engagements, APEC, or the WTO – but seeing you all together shows me the Americas Partnership is real. Our work has truly begun.Together, we have an opportunity to build a regional trade institution from the ground up. To use trade as a force for good. To build our middle classes together, and to bring more voices to the table.That is inspiring.As our Leaders expressed in the East Room Declaration in November, “we recognize the need to accelerate inclusive and sustainable trade and investment in the region, address the climate crisis, and expand social and economic opportunities that leave no one behind.”This is reflection of the need to do trade differently in today’s global economy.Growing economic inequality—and a sense of economic insecurity—are urgent issues we are all grappling with. During the height of the pandemic, we also experienced first-hand how quickly supply chain disruptions can impact our daily lives.Trade is an integral part of addressing these problems, and that is why we are here today.We have an opportunity to do trade in a smarter, more innovative way. This is not easy, but it is a challenge that I am—and I believe all of you are—inspired to take up through the Trade Track.I expect that much of our work in will focus on supply chain resilience. For the Biden-Harris Administration, this is much more than just moving goods around.It is about crafting a new approach to trade policy so that we can adapt and rebound with agility, advance workers’ rights and environmental protections, and drive more inclusive economic prosperity.This is how we can address today’s most pressing challenges, and build durable growth by lifting up more diverse voices in our societies, especially those of underserved communities.This is why USTR recently published – and shared with all of you – a public notice seeking broad input on supply chain resilience.As cited in that announcement, a cornerstone of our approach is collaborating with trading partners to incentivize a race to the top through stronger coordination and alignment on labor and environmental protections within trusted networks.This is how we can advance resilience and create lasting change together.It will be important from my perspective for us to find a way to discuss these issues in the Trade Track, which is why we have proposed the inclusion of specific committees on Trade and Labor and Trade and Environment.These committees are not intended to put any one of us on the spot and are not meant to replace important bilateral dialogues. Rather, our intention is to discuss how we could work together on issues of common concern that affect our hemisphere.I am confident that working with you in the Partnership will provide immediate opportunities to explore creative ideas among governments – and with a broad range of stakeholders across the region.I would like to emphasize the importance of an inclusive approach, both in consultation practices and in policy, and how the United States has integrated the values of equity and equality into our work.For example, during our host year for APEC last year, we centered the role of trade in advancing economic inclusion for women and historically underserved groups. This resulted in the Leader-level San Francisco Principles on Integrating Inclusivity and Sustainability into Trade and Investment Policy.We also sought comments from the public on how we can design trade and investment policy to expand the benefits of trade to include historically underrepresented, underserved, and overburdened communities.The Partnership is another opportunity for such efforts. As President Biden says, so that more people have a fair shot.I know our Senior Officials have already set up a committee to examine issues of inclusive trade and small and medium-sized enterprises, and I look forward to seeing that work progress.In fact, I look forward to hearing about all our priorities. So, let me ask you all to introduce yourselves and share some opening remarks.nn###",

The RHSC is a network of experts from regulatory agencies, industry, academia, and standards development organizations facilitating cooperation among medical product regulatory authorities. It aims to achieve this by building human capacity in regulatory science among medical product regulatory staff.nDuring the 2023 U.S. APEC host year we sought to strengthen primary health care and its linkages to pandemic prevention, preparedness, and response, advance innovation in digital health, and strengthen gender and health equity in the economy. The RHSC’s optimistic future underscores the critical importance the U.S. APEC host year played in reinvigorating this important and life-saving work. Such achievement has been made possible because of the exemplary interagency collaboration among the Department of State, Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, and Office of the United States Trade Representative, and a whole-of-government effort to continue furthering APEC’s work spanning a wide range of policy domains within health and the economy.nFor further information, please contact the U.S. APEC Team atDOSAPEC@state.gov.nn###",

    "content": "ABU DHABI – On February 28, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai delivered remarks at the Working Session on Dispute Settlement Reform at the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Thirteenth Ministerial Conference (MC13).In her remarks, Ambassador Tai emphasized the progress made through the interest-based approach to dispute settlement reform thus far and recognized the efforts of WTO Members in fostering productive discussions. Ambassador Tai also reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to working with other WTO Members to having a well-functioning dispute settlement system that is accessible to all WTO Members.During MC13, WTO Members adopted aMinisterial Decisionon dispute settlement reform.Ambassador Tai’s remarks are below:In the midst of our deliberations at the WTO, we at times get lost in the forest and see only the trees. In this context, it can be helpful to pull back and look at surroundings, to look at context and history to understand better where we are today.The WTO is 29 years old this year – and the institution is showing its age. For the entirety of the time that the WTO has been operating, we have had a Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) review exercise where our legal advisors got together every few months to talk about how to improve the system by reforming the DSU.This is an important part of our history: Since the beginning, WTO Members have acknowledged that the system was not perfect when it was brought forward. There was a recognition that there would be an opportunity to improve and reform the system.The DSU review exercise was active for nearly 20 years. And we sit here today without any reform to show for it. It was a classic WTO negotiation – officials came from capital with their positions, engaged with one another – and nothing happened.Let’s compare that experience with where we are today.After MC12, less than two years ago, an interest-based process was initiated through U.S. efforts. This marked a different way of engaging with each other—not a discussion that is chilled from putting down positions, which is the typical negotiation dynamics that we see at the WTO and in every other negotiating room in Abu Dhabi right now.Through this interest-based process, every Member was asked to identify and share the interests that they want served by a WTO system that supports Members in resolving disputes with other WTO Members. Because the reality is that all WTO Members have trade tensions – this is just the world we live in. But, historically, only a small subset of us have availed ourselves of the tools that were created for all of us.You took us up on this effort. Hundreds of interests were collected from WTO Members. Instead of beginning the discussion with a position or a proposal with each of our preferred text or words, Members identified their respective interests in dispute settlement.We must recognize the work of the facilitator in the effort to take forward the discussion on these interests. We were fortunate to have amongst us someone so skilled in convening and bringing Members to the table and fostering a process for real conversation.The facilitator organized discussions on these interests around 12 groups of interests. The collective and collaborative work resulted in draft text totaling 50 pages of potential reforms that would advance shared interests.It is important to give ourselves credit when credit is due. In just a year, we have made amazing progress. We have made more progress in one year than was made in nearly 20 years of the sometimes painful DSU review process.The interest-based approach to discussions reflects a maturation of negotiation dynamics in Geneva. It is serving us well and will continue to do so. My officials tell me that the dispute settlement reform conversation is the only one where delegates come and actually talk to each other, instead of talking at each other. I want to appreciate how phenomenal this is.I want to express the commitment of the United States to continuing with this interest-based process. With motivation and in good faith, we are working to achieve the commitment at MC12 to conduct discussions with the view to having a fully and well-functioning dispute settlement system – that is accessible to all Members – by 2024.The work ahead of us is going to be hard. But frankly, everything at the WTO is hard. The WTO is worth this effort.For WTO Members that have never used dispute settlement or are infrequent users, let me reflect to you that the interest-based approach is for all of us, including and especially you. Some of us have loud voices. But the interest-based process is meant to include everyone so that when we stand up a fully and well-functioning system again, each Member can see its interests reflected in it.I want to close by affirming that this work is important to me. I started my life in trade policy as a WTO litigator. I want to celebrate the work of our legal advisors. They are not the fancy Ministers in this room, but they are making progress in the rooms where meaningful conversations are taking place. And in doing so, they are potentially creating for all of us a more mature way for WTO negotiators to come together to discuss issues, as well as potentially creating for us an improved way for Members to resolve trade disputes.In closing, and on a personal level, I want to reiterate that I care deeply about this institution and the dispute settlement mechanism in particular. Although it developed problems over time, there is an opportunity for us now to continue to engage – with constructiveness and with collaboration – to create something new and better for all.n###",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai released the following statement after attending the Thirteenth Ministerial Conference (MC13) of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates:n“In less than two years since WTO Members embraced a reform agenda, Members started to make good on that promise at MC13. In particular, the United States applauds the significant amount of work done on dispute settlement reform and recognizes that additional efforts are needed to finish the work we set out to do at MC12.Our approach to those negotiations has produced more results in one year than previous reform efforts had achieved in decades. This is precisely because Members have worked to identify shared interests and build convergence in a collaborative way. Members are identifying new ideas and improvements that can help all of us more effectively resolve disputes and make the system more accessible at the same time.The United States recognizes that reform is an ongoing process, and we hope that this more collaborative, interest-based approach to negotiations can be expanded to facilitate progress in other negotiations.In addition to dispute settlement reform, Members reached agreement on several other important decisions. We agreed to continue the Work Program on Electronic Commerce and to extend the current practice of not imposing customs duties on electronic transmissions. We also agreed to extend the moratorium on initiating non-violation and situation complaints under the TRIPS Agreement until the next Ministerial Conference.Additionally, Members delivered several significant development outcomes at MC13.We welcomed the accession of two new least-developed country (LDC) Members, Comoros and Timor-Leste. The United States looks forward to working with them as they implement their post-accession strategies.We also ensured that Members graduating from the LDC category can continue a smooth transition, agreed to support their capacity to effectively utilize the Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade and Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, supported a work program for small and vulnerable economies, and agreed to hold dedicated sessions on issues important to land-locked developing countries.During this Ministerial, Members also exchanged views on respective priorities for taking the work of the WTO forward. The discussions highlighted that, as the WTO evolves to keep pace with the modern global economy, important debates are emerging among developing economies, large and small, over what rules and policies best serve their interests, particularly on issues such as inclusivity, sustainable development, industrial development, and the need for our trade policies to be flexible to allow Members to manage current global challenges. The United States remains committed to working with other WTO Members to develop a common agenda that allows all of us to have our priorities reflected.In this regard, the United States is disappointed that Members were unable to reach consensus at MC13 on additional provisions to achieve a comprehensive agreement on fisheries subsidies. The United States is similarly disappointed that Members were not able to reach consensus at MC13 on agriculture, including with respect to export restrictions of food destined for least-developed country Members (LDCs). This commitment would have been a valuable deliverable for food-insecure LDCs. Nonetheless, the United States will continue to engage with other Members to achieve meaningful outcomes on these important issues.nThe United States recognizes that change is hard. We remain committed and engaged. We are continuing our collective work to shift the focus back to the WTO’s founding principles and values. We are advancing a positive vision for trade across all levels of development, and we are moving forward with a comprehensive reform agenda.We need an organization that can effectively reflect the needs of all people, and we are taking steps to get there. The Biden-Harris Administration takes pride in continuing our active role in this effort.”nn###",

    "content": "The Office of the United States Trade Representative today releasedPresident Biden’s 2024 Trade Policy Agenda and 2023 Annual Report to Congress, which details USTR’s work to advance President Biden’s trade agenda.  The President’s 2024 Trade Policy Agenda stands up for workers’ rights and sustainable trade practices, supports U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishers, and food manufacturers, bolsters supply chain resilience, addresses unfair policies and practices, and advances inclusive, durable trade policy through expanded engagement.“Trade is an integral part of our Administration’s vision to fundamentally shift our economic policies to focus on strengthening our middle class and working communities,”Ambassador Katherine Tai said.  “The 2024 Trade Policy Agenda and 2023 Annual Report include key accomplishments and priorities to realize this vision.  We are creating new and innovative trade arrangements with our allies and partners, enforcing existing ones, and bringing more diverse voices to the table—to drive inclusive economic growth for more people across our society.”USTR is implementing the Biden-Harris Administration’s economic vision by negotiating historic trade arrangements with our allies and partners:nnnnUnder Ambassador Tai’s leadership, USTR is delivering important wins for domestic agricultural stakeholders, including farmers, producers, and processors, as U.S. agricultural exports totaled $181 billion in 2023.Through the United States – Mexico – Canada Agreement (USMCA), USTR is empowering workers and defending the interests of U.S. energy and agricultural producers.  This includes using the USMCA’s Rapid Response Mechanism to bring tangible benefits to workers, including higher wages, safer working conditions, and reinstatement and backpay to those who were terminated for participating in union activity.In line with the Biden-Harris Administration’s goal of creating economic prosperity for all, USTR is taking unprecedented steps to promote equitable, inclusive, and durable trade policy.  This includes hosting first-ever minister-level dialogues with labor and Indigenous leaders during the U.S. host year for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).At the World Trade Organization (WTO), building on the progress made at the Thirteenth Ministerial Conference, Ambassador Tai is working with other WTO Members to reform the organization to restore transparency, rebuild its ability to address emerging challenges, and make the dispute settlement system more effective.USTR will continue to deliver for U.S. workers and businesses, and for a global trading system that is more resilient, sustainable and equitable.nBackground:nThe 2024 Trade Policy Agenda and 2023 Annual Report of the President of the United States on the Trade Agreements Program are submitted to the Congress pursuant to Section 163 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended.n###",

    "content": "ABU DHABI – United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai today delivered remarks at the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC) Panel on Transforming the WTO to Deliver Social Justice, on the margins of the Thirteenth World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference (MC13).In her remarks, Ambassador Tai underscored the need for trade to empower working communities and to help build the middle class.  Ambassador Tai also emphasized that the WTO must shift its focus to workers, in line with the organization’s founding principles, to ensure the benefits of trade are shared broadly.Ambassador Tai’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below:nThank you, Luc.  I am delighted to be here.  Let me also thank my colleagues and distinguished guests who have made time to attend this important panel discussion.I am glad the ITUC put together this panel to provide all of us with the opportunity to discuss the important nexus between trade and labor, and critically, to do so in the framework of the WTO.The Biden-Harris Administration believes that trade should be a force for good, for everyone, but to do so we must work to ensure that trade empowers workers and that working communities enjoy the benefits of trade.Trade policy has historically centered around maximum tariff liberalization and the pursuit of efficiency and low costs.This approach focused on providing benefits for our biggest companies, on the theory that those benefits would necessarily trickle down to our workers, small businesses, and communities.But over time, what we have seen is that these benefits do not trickle very far down.Over the last three years, our Administration has been focused on fundamentally shifting this narrative to focus on the middle class and workers through what we call a worker-centered trade policy.This means we are centering workers in our trade policy development, in our assessments of whether a particular policy position is working effectively, and in our implementation and enforcement actions.It means that we judge our success not just on how much we trade, but on how that trade helps to support decent work, including good-paying, rights-respecting, secure, and safe jobs for workers.This policy is in line with a broader, government-wide approach to global labor issues, that was recently outlined in the November 2023 Presidential Memorandum on Advancing Worker Empowerment, Rights, and High Labor Standards Globally.One priority identified in our Global Rights Strategy is seeking greater cooperation on labor issues in multilateral forums, like the WTO.Working people in many of our societies are reporting an increasing sense of economic insecurity, and our work at the WTO can focus more on better reflecting their interests.That can include exchanging information on how we are using innovative trade tools to drive a race to the top for our working people.For the United States, one example is how we have been fervently using the Rapid Response Mechanism, or the RRM, under the United States – Mexico – Canada Agreement.This mechanism is transformative in that it allows us to bring cases against specific facilities that do not respect the rights of workers to freedom of association and collective bargaining.Since 2021, the United States has sought Mexico’s review under the RRM 19 times at facilities that span various industries, including automotive, garments, mining, and services.These cases have directly benefited over 27,000 workers in Mexico.  Free and fair elections to select independent unions.  New collective bargaining agreements.  Major salary increases.  Reinstatements for those wrongfully terminated.  Safer working conditions.For the WTO to remain effective and relevant, we need to shift our focus to workers, in line with the organization’s founding principles, which include raising living standards and ensuring full employment.The good news is that the WTO and the multilateral trading system’s rules were never meant to be immutable or static.  The creators of the WTO envisioned an organization that would change and adapt through negotiations among its Members.This is why we are working with other WTO Members and Dr. Ngozi on a comprehensive reform agenda.  And we are making progress along the way.Last year, we achieved a groundbreaking agreement in the decades-long WTO fisheries subsidies negotiations.We are proud to be among the first WTO members to accept the WTO Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies, which is the first ever multilateral trade agreement with environmental sustainability at its core.By prohibiting harmful subsidies, this agreement will help support the livelihoods of fishers and workers in the United States and around the world.nAs part of the next phase of negotiations for this agreement, we are working to shine a light on the use of forced labor on fishing vessels, which is not just a human rights and moral issue, but a fair competition issue.This is one example of how we can work together at the WTO to bring labor issues to the fore.All of you here play an important role in realizing this vision, and I look forward to our discussion.  Thank you.nn###",

    "content": "ABU DHABI – The United States delegation today delivered remarks at the Ministerial Conversation on Trade and Inclusion during the Thirteenth World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference (MC13).In their remarks, the delegation shared how the United States is building an inclusive trade agenda by incorporating more diverse voices into the policymaking process and by taking a data-driven approach to understanding the distributional effects of trade on working communities. They also underscored how the WTO must focus on representing the interests of more people across societies.The delegation’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below:Hello, everyone.  It is great to be here with all of you for this important discussion.The United States is fully committed to building an inclusive trade policy agenda.To ensure that more people enjoy the benefits of trade, especially those that have been historically marginalized or underrepresented.  To incorporate their voices and priorities in our policies and initiatives.  And to take a data-driven approach to understanding the distributional effects of trade on workers and their communities.Last year alone, USTR visited more than 20 U.S. states to hear directly from farmers, agricultural producers, workers, union leaders, Indigenous leaders, small business owners, and community-based organizations.We are meeting people where they are and laying the groundwork to build and sustain trusted lines of communication with more communities throughout the United States.This is a key component of our work to ensure that our trade policies are equitable and durable.We are collaborating with our trading partners to find new ways to empower new voices and create more seats at the decision-making table, including by developing new inclusivity chapters in our trade initiatives.This should also be a focus at the WTO.The United States offered a paper in January to share ideas about how to integrate these approaches into our work.This includes improving the transparency in our decision-making processes and the ability of all our stakeholders—especially those that historically had less access—to provide input, access, and learn about the WTO.Not only that, by improving the availability of data and research, we can better analyze and assess the social impacts of trade policies on different people and communities across WTO Members.APEC provides a useful example, where economies last year developed a set of principles on integrating inclusivity and sustainability into trade and investment policy, to bring more voices to the table and deliver tangible benefits to more people.This work is highly relevant to the WTO today and to the WTO we want to build, together.The WTO can better represent the interests of more people across our societies and help unleash the full economic potential of MSMEs, women, Indigenous Peoples, persons with disabilities, and people from rural and remote areas.We are grateful for the topic today so that we can bring this dialogue into the WTO.  We stand ready to share our own experiences and continue these exchanges among Members in a sustained and deeper way after this Ministerial Conference.nn###",

    "content": "ABU DHABI – United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai today delivered remarks at the Ministerial Conversation on Trade and Sustainable Development, Including Trade and Industrial Policy and Policy Space for Industrial Development, during the Thirteenth World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference (MC13).In her remarks, Ambassador Tai emphasized that trade can be a positive force for sustainable development if it is used to empower workers, protect the environment, and promote fair competition.  Ambassador Tai also stressed the need for the WTO to address each of these areas in order to drive sustainable trade.Ambassador Tai’s remarks as prepared for delivery are below:Thank you, Chair.  These conversations on cross-cutting issues are extremely important.  We appreciate the opportunity to engage.We are a diverse group of economies, yet we face common challenges—a worsening climate crisis, rapid technological change, and widening inequality.We are here to figure out how to tackle these challenges together and to use trade as a positive force for sustainable development.For the United States, there are three prongs to approaching this topic: labor, environment, and fair competition.First, we need to recognize that workers are the backbone of our resilience.This is crucial at a time when working people in many of our societies are reporting an increasing sense of economic insecurity.  So, trade policies at home and at the WTO must better reflect their interests.This is why, in the negotiations on fisheries subsidies, we have been highlighting the need to have a basic level of transparency regarding vessels or operators using forced labor.These practices have a competitive impact on all those hardworking fishers who do not engage in such practices.The second prong is the environment.There is also a lot of work happening right now in Geneva on this topic—because WTO Members agree that we need to better understand the challenges and opportunities of the green transition for our economies and people.But we also need to focus on how the WTO can support and facilitate Members taking meaningful actions on climate.  And we cannot lose sight of the first dimension—the workers.There is incredible potential in the green economy, but that potential will only be fully realized if we forge new paths to empower our people and deliver real, lasting change for the better.We cannot fully achieve this vision when some Members use non-market economic policies to build global market dominance that can be abused.  And this is the third and final prong, fair competition.Non-market policies and practices undermine fair competition.  They create trade distortions and non-market excess capacity, which undermine our sustainability objectives and climate goals.They also block opportunities for Members of all stages of development to participate in supply networks.We need to have real conversations on all three of these issues if we want to drive sustainable trade through the WTO.The United States stands ready to work with all Members on this important topic.Thank you.nn###",

We express our deep sadness at the devastating human losses and profound suffering caused by Russia’s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine, which continues for the third year in gross violation of international law, including the Charter of the United Nations. In so doing, we reiterate our full support for the UN General Assembly Resolution of 2 March 2022 (A/RES/ES-11/1) and all other resolutions adopted by the UN General Assembly at its eleventh emergency special session.nWe reaffirm our commitment to Ukraine’s fight for its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity and call for the Russian Federation to immediately, completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from the territory of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders.nRussia’s war of aggression against Ukraine continues to have devastating global and regional impacts, including on Ukraine’s economy and ability to trade. The destruction of significant parts of Ukraine’s transportation, port infrastructure, and grain storage facilities as well as mining of agricultural land is impeding Ukraine’s ability to produce, export, and import normally. We are gravely concerned about the consequences of this destruction for Ukraine and for global trade, in particular with regard to the supply to international markets of a number of key commodities produced by Ukraine, including agricultural and food products, fertilizers, and critical minerals. We are also deeply concerned by numerous reports of grain being plundered by Russia from Ukraine. These actions violate the principles and values of the WTO.nUkraine is one of the world’s top exporters of key agricultural products such as wheat, maize, barley, and sunflower oil. We recognize Ukraine’s determination, despite Russia’s war of aggression, to ensure food security and supply to some of the most vulnerable parts of the world, particularly developing countries. In this regard, the “Grain from Ukraine” initiative continues to be an important tool to help to respond to hunger. Russia weaponized food, and hit the world’s most vulnerable with its sea blockade. We praise Ukraine’s achievement of reopening grain exports by its Black Sea corridor to the global markets and welcome the establishment in 2022 of the EU Solidarity Lanes, which have allowed the exports of around 67 million tons of grain since May 2022 from Ukraine to global markets. This benefits all countries, notably the countries most in need. In this context, it is necessary to ensure free, full, and safe navigation in the Black and Azov Seas and ensure that sea routes and ports are not threatened or blocked by threat of or use of force.nRussia’s war of aggression against Ukraine has also caused profound environmental damage to Ukraine and resulted in unprecedented pollution and disruption of the regional ecosystems.nWe underscore the need to reach, as soon as possible, a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace in Ukraine, in full respect of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, based on the principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We welcome Ukraine’s efforts aimed at achieving peace, including through the principles laid out in President Zelenskyy’s 10 Point Peace Formula. We reiterate that the Russian Federation must bear the legal consequences of all of its internationally wrongful acts, including making reparation for injury and loss, including for any humanitarian, economic, and environmental damage caused by such acts.nWe will continue work to support Ukraine and to facilitate its exports and supply chains for the benefit of global food security. We encourage all WTO Members to do likewise in a manner commensurate with their capacity, including by facilitating the use of infrastructure, as well as facilitating and simplifying customs procedures. Within the capacity of each WTO Member, we will continue to provide assistance to Ukraine to alleviate the suffering of the Ukrainian people. We will also look for practical ways to help and assist Ukraine in its reconstruction efforts, activities, and projects to overcome the negative consequences of Russia’s war of aggression.nn###",

    "content": "WASHINGTON – Today, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro (CT-03), Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Committee, sent aletterto President Biden praising the Administration’s efforts to align the United States’ trade agenda on the digital economy with its broader goals of respecting our legislators’ and regulators’ right to regulate in the public interest, particularly in this rapidly evolving industry. The letter was co-signed by 88 members of Congress, including 13 Ranking Members.In her letter, Congresswoman DeLauro and her co-signers also commended the Administration and Ambassador Katherine Tai’s work to ensure domestic policy-makers are able to determine a path forward for the United States on digital policy before it is written into international trade policy.nRead the full letter here:Dear Mr. President:nWe are writing to commend Ambassador Katherine Tai’s approach to developing and implementing your Administration’s inclusive and worker-centered trade policy, especially on matters related to the digital economy.nWe appreciate greatly Ambassador Tai’s acknowledgement that trade officials should not attempt to preempt Congress on domestic policy through trade negotiations. It is a credit to your presidency that Ambassador Tai is proceeding in a manner that respects Congress’ role in setting domestic policy and that honors your digital competition, privacy, and artificial intelligence (AI) oversight goals, which we also support. For instance, during the Aspen Security Forum Ambassador Tai noted that your Administration has deliberately examined the position taken by the previous Administration on certain digital trade matters to assess whether it aligns with your Administration’s regulatory approach, the debates in Congress, and the broader public conversation regarding these issues. We agree with Ambassador Tai’s assessment that getting ahead of the domestic debates on these issues would be malpractice.nYour Administration’s approach contrasts favorably with the previous Administration, which used trade agreements to derail domestic policy debates. Specifically, the Trump Administration inserted several “digital trade” provisions favored by Big Tech interests into the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. These provisions, which had not been in past U.S. trade agreements, were designed to limit the regulation of domestic online privacy and data security matters, gig worker protection, AI oversight, tech anti-monopoly, and other important policies.nWe appreciate that Ambassador Tai has made clear at the World Trade Organization and in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework negotiations that your Administration will not allow these Trump-era rules to derail the debate in the U.S. Congress on crafting rules for the digital economy. As you may know, dozens of bills have been introduced so far in the 118thCongress, many of them with bipartisan support, that would establish online privacy, data security, online civil rights and liberties, AI oversight, and anti-trust policies. We are concerned that trade negotiations on certain digital rules could get ahead of Congress’ domestic policymaking.nWe also want to commend you for Ambassador Tai’s strong and strategic approach to trade policy with countries who are not our allies, such as China and Russia. Ambassador Tai reasserted our rights to limit the flow of Americans’ data to such countries by withdrawing U.S. support for Trump-era WTO proposals that granted data brokers and digital platforms all but total control of Americans’ data. These proposed provisions would have constrained Congress and U.S. government agencies from restricting the flows of Americans’ data for national security or privacy reasons.nWe look forward to working with your Administration to ensure that any trade rules covering digital policy provide Congress with the policy space needed to safeguard the interests of American workers, entrepreneurs, smaller businesses, and consumers.nn###",

I’m Katherine Tai, the United States Trade Representative.nI first want to thank the EU for co-sponsoring this important event, and especially my friend Executive Vice President Dombrovskis for being such a great partner.nWe spent the day together yesterday at the TTC ministerial and covered a lot of ground. Our transatlantic trade relationship is important, and I’m so proud of the work we have accomplished this past year.nBut we know there’s more we can do, to use trade as a force for good for our people and our planet.nThis is especially true when we’re talking about our shared goals, like addressing global steel and aluminum excess capacity and emissions intensity, strengthening the resilience and sustainability of our supply chains, and ensuring a just and inclusive green transition.nThese are key pillars to the Biden-Harris Administration’s trade agenda, to deliver tangible benefits to working people and their communities. And the TTC and the TIST are central to the transatlantic relationship, to further deepen our cooperation on these issues.nYesterday, we opened this event with a workshop focused on labor and the just transition. I was so pleased to see such a robust participation from our labor and business communities on both sides of the Atlantic.nStakeholders from labor and business engaged in a productive discussion on issues related to the green transition and how we can create good-paying jobs as a part of our climate policy and investments. We also talked about the importance of workers having that seat at the table to engage on environmental issues that directly impact them.nPresident Biden often says that, when he thinks climate change, he thinks jobs, and I completely agree. And not just that. When we think climate change, we think good jobs. The green transition is an opportunity to equip and empower more communities across our societies, and you all play an important role in making that happen.nWe need everyone’s voices—especially workers’ voices—to shape and build policies that will affect their and our future. It’s more than just having folks at the table though—it’s about incorporating their priorities into the heart of our work.nBecause only then can we really build our middle classes together, and instead of pitting them against each other.nThis is also at the heart of our work on advancing our shared decarbonization and climate priorities.nWe are collaborating on innovative ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in energy-intensive industries while also focusing on making our supply chains more resilient and sustainable for the clean economy.nTackling the climate crisis and advancing sustainable trade policy is not easy—trust me I know it’s hard work. And we need new, innovative approaches to solve today’s novel problems.nThis is why your input is so central to our work. The time that you invested into organizing this event will not go unnoticed, and we look forward to hearing your ideas on how we can move forward, together.nMy first speech as the USTR, was back in April 2021, and it was on this very topic of trade policy, the environment, and the climate crisis.nSo much has changed since then, including ongoing and increasing geopolitical challenges.nBut one thing that remains constant is the Biden-Harris Administration’s commitment to tackle the climate crisis and to bring about a just and inclusive green transition for workers. And we know that we will do this together with trusted partners like the EU and all of you.nThis is truly a team effort—no one government or organization or company can do this alone.nThere is incredible potential in the green economy—but that potential will only be fully realized if we are courageous enough to forge new paths; empower our people; and deliver real, lasting change for the better.nThat’s the kind of future I know we can build together.nThank you so much for all that you do, and I wish you a productive event.nn###",

    "content": "New Delhin1.         The 14th Ministerial-level meeting of the India-United States Trade Policy Forum (TPF) was held in New Delhi, India on January 12, 2024.   Minister of Commerce and Industry, India, Shri Piyush Goyal and U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Katherine Tai co-chaired the TPF meeting.n2.         The Ministers underlined the significance of the TPF in forging robust bilateral trade ties and in enhancing the overall economic relationship. They welcomed the strong momentum in  India-US bilateral trade in goods and services, which continued to rise and likely surpassed $200 billion in calendar year 2023 despite a challenging global trade environment. They acknowledged that considering the size of their economies, significant potential remains unrealized and expressed their mutual desire to further enhance engagement with the goal of continuing to increase and diversify bilateral trade.  In this regard, the Ministers underlined the significance of the TPF in forging a robust economic relationship.n3.         The Ministers took stock of the significant progress made in addressing concerns impacting the bilateral trade relationship since the 13thTPF held in January 2023. This was highlighted by the historic settlement of all seven longstanding trade disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) between the two countries as well as the understandings on market access related to products of significance to the bilateral trade relationship. These outcomes were delivered in the context of the historic state visit of India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States in June 2023 and subsequently during the visit of U.S. President Biden to India for the G20 Summit in September 2023.n4.         The Ministers agreed that their governments will pursue enhanced engagement leading to mutually beneficial outcomes in several areas, with a view to deepen the trade relationship for the benefit of working people.  They identified certain areas, including critical minerals, customs and trade facilitation, supply chains, and trade in high tech products, in which the United States and India will develop an ambitious and forward looking roadmap for enhanced cooperation in order to achieve economically meaningful outcomes. The Ministers committed to pursue these efforts with a view to establish the foundation to launch future joint initiatives.n5.         Ambassador Tai congratulated India on the successful completion and hosting of the G20 Presidency and the G20 summit, which saw the unanimous adoption of the G20 New Delhi Leaders’ Declaration. She welcomed the positive outcomes achieved in the G20 Trade and Investment Working Group, and in particular the adoption of the High Level Principles on Digitalization of Trade Documents. The Ministers agreed to further pursue support for the implementation of these principles in other forums so as to strengthen the pathways for digitalization of trade documents. The Ministers emphasized that the G20 is a valuable platform for initiating constructive dialogue and fostering cooperation among members on global trade issues and agreed to work together in that regard.nProgress on Bilateral Trade Concernsn6.         The Ministers highlighted the work undertaken by the TPF Working Groups since the 13th TPF Ministerial through regular high-level meetings. They expressed their intent to continue to work together on resolving outstanding trade issues and highlighted both progress and upcoming engagement on a select number of those issues.nNon-Agricultural Goodsn7.        The Ministers agreed to establish a pathway in which India and the United States will mutually recognize results from accredited conformity assessment bodies utilizing International Laboratory Accreditation Cooperation (ILAC) and International Accreditation Forum (IAF) mutual recognition arrangements (MRAs), on a bilateral basis whenever possible.  This will allow labs and conformity assessment bodies to certify that products are compliant with certain standards.  This would eliminate duplicative testing requirements and reduce compliance costs for trade in high-quality goods.  The Ministers committed to identify priority sectors of mutual interest for implementation and establish a Joint Facilitative Mechanism (JFM) for the same, the terms of reference of which will be finalized at the earliest.n8.The Ministers welcomed the finalization of the Turtle Excluder Device (TED) design developed with the technical support of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  The collaboration between India and the United States to expedite the TED demonstrations will confirm that the TED design effectively minimizes the impact of commercial shrimp trawl operations on sea turtle populations. The Ministers acknowledged that NOAA has scheduled its visit to India for February 2024 to carry out field demonstrations with the newly designed TED and conduct workshops for stakeholders.  Both sides acknowledged that the timely completion of the field demonstrations could contribute to the sustainable management and protection of marine and coastal ecosystems, thereby fostering enhanced seafood trade between the two countries.n9.         The Ministers reiterated their commitment to ensure that technical regulations, such as Quality Control Orders, do not create unnecessary barriers to trade by providing sufficient opportunities for stakeholder consultations and ensuring that relevant domestic standards align with international standards to the extent feasible.10.       The Ministers emphasized their mutual interest in furthering public health discussions to ensure safe and effective medical products. India emphasized the need to increase the number of inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) in India to facilitate trade and continue to reduce the backlog.  The United States appreciated India’s remarks, noting that the U.S. FDA has increased staffing to increase pharmaceutical inspections conducted by the agency.11.       The Ministers acknowledged the ongoing discussions related to ensuring patient access to affordable medical devices, including through the Trade Margin Rationalization (TMR) approach.  They also emphasized the importance of enhancing engagement to address measures that could negatively impact the ongoing trade in the sector, such as standards and pricing issues for medical devices, including for cardiac stents and knee implants.
